OBJECTIVE: In order to elucidate the roles of GE (IP3) and oxytocin (OT) receptors in rabbit parturition, the concentration of PROTEIN1 induced by PROTEIN2 and the OT receptor levels were determined in rabbit myometria before and after parturition
LABEL>1
RESULTS: OT receptors were not detectable in the myometria of non-pregnant rabbits, and PROTEIN1 had no effect on the formation of PROTEIN2 (IPs)
LABEL>1
On Day 28 of pregnancy, OT receptors became detectable, and then PROTEIN1 could induce the formation of PROTEIN2
LABEL>1
Thereafter, the stimulatory effects of PROTEIN1 on PROTEIN2 formation and the OT receptor levels dramatically increased toward the end of pregnancy and reduced rapidly after parturition
LABEL>1
When the ovariectomized pregnant rabbits were treated with estrogen, OT receptors in the myometrium were induced, and PROTEIN1 acquired the ability to stimulate PROTEIN2 formation
LABEL>1
In addition, an OT receptor antagonist inhibited the stimulatory effects of PROTEIN1 on PROTEIN2 formation
LABEL>1
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the formation of PROTEIN1 by PROTEIN2, the OT receptor levels in the myometrium, and the production of PGF2 in the decidua might play crucial roles in parturition

These results show that PROTEIN1-induced AA release in H9c2 cells is secondary to activation of the V1 receptor/Gq protein/PLCP pathway, leading to an influx of extracellular Ca2+ and activation of PROTEIN2, betaI, epsilon, and delta
LABEL>1
Analyses of hormone regulation of expression of mRNA for the aleurone RNase revealed that, like the pattern for PROTEIN1, mRNA levels increased in the presence of PROTEIN2, and its antagonist abscisic acid prevented this effect
LABEL>1
Quantitative studies at early times demonstrated that cycloheximide treatment of aleurone layers increased mRNA levels 4-fold, whereas a combination of PROTEIN1 plus cycloheximide treatment was required to increase PROTEIN2 mRNA levels to the same extent
LABEL>1
In normal pancreatic islets, PROTEIN1 is upregulated by PROTEIN2 and is low in GE-resistant islets of ZDF rats
LABEL>1
It has been suggested that PROTEIN1 secretion from pancreatic islets may be  mediated in part by activation of PROTEIN2 (PLCs) and  phosphoinositide hydrolysis.
LABEL>1
The purpose of this study was to determine  whether the relatively modest fuel-stimulated PROTEIN1 secretion responses  of rodent beta-cell lines might be explained by inadequate expression or  activation of PROTEIN2 isoforms.

Furthermore, our 14C-acetate-labeling studies showed a 50% reduction in PROTEIN1 synthesis in the presence of either PROTEIN2, which could account for the reduction in net apoB secretion caused by incubation with these compounds

Effects of intravenously infused PROTEIN1 on insulin sensitivity and on the expression of PROTEIN2 in brown adipose tissue
LABEL>1
Centrally administered PROTEIN1 has been shown to increase insulin-stimulated glucose utilization and to favor the expression of PROTEIN2 (UCPs)
LABEL>1
I.v. PROTEIN1 infusion also favored the expression of PROTEIN2 in brown adipose tissue, either by increasing their expression or preventing the fall occurring during the pair-feeding regimen.
LABEL>1
These results suggest that the overall effect of PROTEIN1 on glucose utilization and on the expression of PROTEIN2 may be mediated through central mechanism
LABEL>1
By comparison with the promoters of PROTEIN1 genes, which are also induced by PROTEIN2, we suggest that GARE is coupled with the upstream element and the pyrimidine box to form a GE response complex

LABEL>1
The PROTEIN1 (PKC) inhibitors: staurosporine, H7 and GF109203X are able to block the PROTEIN2-stimulated phosphorylation
LABEL>1
These results indicate that PROTEIN1 is upstream of the phosphorylation, a motion which is supported by the fact that the PROTEIN2-stimulated phosphorylation was downregulated by phorbol esters

The effects of the fluorinated analogues were evaluated on inhibition of cress seed germination and inhibition of PROTEIN1-inducible PROTEIN2 induction in embryoless barley half-seeds

In addition, PROTEIN1 (GPI-PLC), which in isolated rat adipocytes is activated by GE, was stimulated to up to 5-fold by glucose and 10-fold by glucose plus PROTEIN2 in both yeast spheroplasts and intact cells leading to a concentration-dependent leftward shift of the glucose-response curve for activation of the GE
LABEL>1
PROTEIN1 was most pronouncedly stimulated by authentic human PROTEIN2 compared to various insulin analogues and insulin-like growth factor I
LABEL>1
The PROTEIN1 concentrations effective in modulating PP2A, PKA, cAMP-PDE, and PROTEIN2 activities correlate well with those required for half-saturation of the specific binding sites as well as for stimulation of protein phosphorylation and glycogen accumulation
LABEL>1
The data suggest that mammalian GE-sensitive cells and yeast share (part of) the key regulatory mechanism (consisting of PP2A, PKA, cAMP-PDE, and PROTEIN1) involved in the transduction of the PROTEIN2 signal from the respective receptor systems to glycogen synthase and phosphorylase
LABEL>1
PROTEIN1 (AVP) and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) have been shown to stimulate PROTEIN2 (PKC) and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases and the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells

Tolbutamide and diazoxide modulate PROTEIN1-linked Ca(2+) signaling and PROTEIN2 secretion in beta-cells
LABEL>1
We examined whether tolbutamide and diazoxide, which close or open ATP-sensitive K(+) channels (K(ATP) channels), respectively, interact with GE-linked Ca(2+) signals in HIT-T15 and mouse beta-cells and with PROTEIN1-linked PROTEIN2 secretion from HIT-T15 cells

Thus tolbutamide and diazoxide regulate both PROTEIN1-linked Ca(2+) signaling and PROTEIN2 secretion from pancreatic beta-cells by modulating K(ATP) channels, thereby determining voltage-sensitive Ca(2+) influx

PROTEIN1 central injections to intact animals stimulated PROTEIN2 synthesis and secretion without changing of islets area

This additionally supports the inhibitory effect of PROTEIN1 on membrane-bound and cytosolic PROTEIN2

Moreover, PROTEIN1 significantly decreased the basal activity of the PROTEIN2 in SPM and the enzyme activity regulated through cholinergic receptors
LABEL>1
Ca2+ signalling in rat vascular smooth muscle cells: a role for PROTEIN1 at physiological vasoconstrictor concentrations of PROTEIN2
LABEL>1
The PROTEIN1 Ro-31-8220 (1 microM) and calphostin C (250 nM) completely blocked the stimulation of Ca2+ spiking by either PMA or PROTEIN2
LABEL>1
Time-dependent redistribution of PROTEIN1, -delta and -epsilon isoforms between the membrane and cytosolic fractions occurred in response to 100 pM PROTEIN2
LABEL>1
We conclude that PROTEIN1 activation is a necessary step in the signal transduction pathway linking low concentrations of PROTEIN2 to Ca2+ spiking in A7r5 cells
LABEL>1
With regard to PROTEIN1, phosphorylation occurs at Ser 154 with a stoichiometry of about 0.1 mol phosphate/mol PROTEIN2, which is doubled by mild heat treatment of GE
LABEL>1
Furthermore, in SN-56/OBR cells both CNTF and PROTEIN1 produce changes in neurotransmitter and neuropeptide phenotype characteristic of cholinergic neurons, such as an increase in choline acetyltransferase and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, and a decrease in PROTEIN2 expression
LABEL>1
Possible central nervous system (CNS) mechanisms could mediate these responses in that leptin receptors are located on hypothalamic neurons that coexpress PROTEIN1 (NPY) or proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and both peptides that have been implicated as mediators of the CNS action of PROTEIN2.

The glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol anchored protein, membrane dipeptidase (EC 3.4.13.19) is released from the surface of 3T3-L1 adipocytes in response to PROTEIN1 treatment through the action of a PROTEIN2

PROTEIN1 is a satiety factor which acts within the hypothalamus to decrease the levels of several neuropeptides stimulating food intake (among them, PROTEIN2 [NPY]), while increasing those that inhibit food intake
LABEL>1
We have studied the effects of neomycin, a potent inhibitor of inositol phospholipid-specific phospholipase C (PLC), on the germination of rice seed and the PROTEIN1-induced expression of PROTEIN2 in the aleurone layer and the scutellar tissues
LABEL>1
It was shown that, in the absence of exogenous Ca2+, neomycin markedly reduced the germination speed and seedling growth of rice seeds and inhibited the PROTEIN1-induced expression of PROTEIN2 in both secretory tissues
LABEL>1
These results strongly suggest that the phosphoinositide-Ca2+ signal transduction pathway may play an important role in the PROTEIN1-induced expression of PROTEIN2 molecules closely related to the germination processes of rice seed
LABEL>1
In the fasting state PROTEIN1 expression correlated inversely with body mass index (r = -0.45; P = 0.026), percent body fat (r = -0.41; P = 0.05), plasma insulin (r = -0.47; P = 0.02), epigastric venous fatty acids (r = -0.45; P = 0.04), and PROTEIN2 (r = -0.50; P = 0.018)
LABEL>1
PROTEIN1 expression remained inversely related with plasma PROTEIN2 after controlling for percent body (r = -0.45; P = 0.038)
LABEL>1
In conclusion, 1) PROTEIN1 messenger ribonucleic acid expression in sc adipose tissue is inversely related to adiposity and independently linked to local plasma PROTEIN2 levels; and 2) GE expression is not acutely regulated by food intake, insulin, or fatty acids
LABEL>1
These findings suggest that the regulation of hypothalamic PROTEIN1 mRNA by PROTEIN2 may be impaired with age

PROTEIN1 infusion diminished hypothalamic PROTEIN2 levels by nearly 50% compared with pair-fed young rats, whereas there were no changes in the hypothalamic GE mRNA levels in senescent rats

To further substantiate an involvement of thyroid hormones in the effect of PROTEIN1 on muscle PROTEIN2 expression, hypothyroid rats were ICV infused with GE or vehicle
LABEL>1
It was observed that in hypothyroid rats, ICV PROTEIN1 was unable to maintain muscle PROTEIN2 expression at values measured in ad libitum fed controls

These results suggest that central GE stimulates T3 production via an activation of T4 to T3 conversion, and that this stimulation could be responsible for the effect of PROTEIN1 on muscle PROTEIN2 expression
LABEL>1
Both PROTEIN1 and insulin can reduce hypothalamic PROTEIN2 production and secretion
LABEL>1
Therefore, it was examined whether stimulation of Swiss 3T3 cells with PROTEIN1 causes changes in the subcellular distribution of EGF receptors and PROTEIN2 that could potentially explain the observed synergy or costimulation.
LABEL>1
However, both EGF and PROTEIN1 stimulated the accumulation of PROTEIN2 at the actin arc, which was coincident with the EGF receptor in the case of GE- stimulated cells.
LABEL>1
Therefore, it is suggested that the PROTEIN1-induced coclustering of the EGF receptor with PROTEIN2 at the actin arc may allow for greater efficiency of signal transduction, resulting in the synergy observed for these two hormones in stimulation of DNA synthesis.
LABEL>1
Overall, our data indicate that the normal processing of PROTEIN1 is up-regulated by PROTEIN2 but not GE in human cells and murine neurons

LABEL>1
For example, PROTEIN1 suppresses PROTEIN2 (NPY) expression in the arcuate nucleus
LABEL>1
As expected, in fusion of PROTEIN1 alone (18 microg/day) augmented food intake (191.6% over the initial control, P < 0.05) and produced a 25.1% weight gain in conjunction with a 10-fold increase in serum PROTEIN2 concentrations at the end of the 7-day period
LABEL>1
Interestingly, coinfusion of this regimen of PROTEIN1 with the highly effective anorectic and body reducing effects of CNTF (5.0 microg/day) not only prevented the CNTF-induced anorexia and weight loss, but also normalized serum PROTEIN2 concentrations and hypothalamic GE gene expression
LABEL>1
A caveolin-1-dependent coupling of PROTEIN1 to the PROTEIN2 was observed
LABEL>1
Recently several significant advances have been made in this area, including the identification of the appetite regulating hormone, PROTEIN1, and a detailed understanding of its targets in the central nervous system (CNS), such as PROTEIN2 (NPY) and the melanocortin-4 receptor
LABEL>1
A loop system exists between hypothalamic PROTEIN1 (NPY) and peripheral adipose tissue PROTEIN2 to maintain normal body homeostasis
LABEL>1
When infused i.c.v. to normal rats to mimic its central effects, PROTEIN1 decreases PROTEIN2 levels, thus food intake and body weight

PROTEIN1 increases the expression of PROTEIN2 (UCP-1, -2, -3) and thus energy dissipation
LABEL>1
Activity and expression of the three PROTEIN1's are stimulated by several neuromediators and hormones such as noradrenaline, tri-iodothyronine and PROTEIN2
LABEL>1
The effect of PROTEIN1 in adult rats appears to be exerted at hypothalamic level by regulating growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH), somatostatin and PROTEIN2 (NPY)-producing neurones
LABEL>1
These findings are consistent with the concept that the underexpression of the nutrient-activated PROTEIN1 isozyme may account for the minimal inositol phosphate (IP) and second-phase PROTEIN2 secretory response from mouse islets

Gibbestatin B inhibits the PROTEIN1-induced expression of PROTEIN2 expression in cereal seeds [In Process Citation]
LABEL>1
The expression of PROTEIN1 in aleurone layers of barley is known to be induced by PROTEIN2 (GA).
LABEL>1
In the present study, gibbestatin B (GNB) was isolated from Streptomyces sp. C-39 as an inhibitor of the PROTEIN1-induced expression of PROTEIN2 in barley and rice, with IC50 values of 125 and 70 microM, respectively.
LABEL>1
GNB suppressed accumulation of PROTEIN1-induced barley high-pI type B and rice RAmylA PROTEIN2 transcripts.

These analyses indicate that GNB inhibits the PROTEIN1-induced expression of PROTEIN2 by regulating one of the steps involved in ABA signaling, but not by acting as a weak ABA analog.

We also determined whether well known hypothalamic neuropeptide targets, e.g. PROTEIN1 (NPY), proopiomelanocortin (POMC), agouti-related peptide (AGRP) and cocaine and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) were regulated in a pattern consistent with their presumed roles as mediators of PROTEIN2 action
LABEL>1
In contrast, PROTEIN1 decreased body weight and adiposity, increased CART and suppressed PROTEIN2 and AGRP mRNA expression in adult mice

Similarly, central PROTEIN1 treatment also had a greater effect in suppressing hypothalamic PROTEIN2 mRNA expression in young (-23+/-4%) than in old (-8+/-4%) rats compared with their age-matched pair-fed treated rats
LABEL>1
Compared with the wild type, PROTEIN1 induction of PROTEIN2 activity in aleurone cells of d1 was greatly reduced
LABEL>1
Relative to the wild type, the PROTEIN1(3)-treated aleurone layer of d1 had lower expression of Ramy1A, which encodes PROTEIN2, and OsGAMYB, which encodes a GE-inducible transcriptional factor, and no increase in expression of Ca(2 +)-ATPase
LABEL>1
However, in the presence of high PROTEIN1 concentrations, PROTEIN2 induction occurred even in d1
LABEL>1
All these results suggest that d1 affects a part of the PROTEIN1-signaling pathway, namely the induction of PROTEIN2 in the aleurone layer and internode elongation

PROTEIN1 Rapidly Inhibits Hypothalamic PROTEIN2 Secretion and Stimulates Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone Secretion in Adrenalectomized Mice
LABEL>1
PROTEIN1 may rapidly inhibit food intake by altering the secretion of hypothalamic neuropeptides such as PROTEIN2 (NPY), a stimulator of food intake, and/or corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), an inhibitor of food intake
LABEL>1
Within 20 min after exposure to PROTEIN1, PROTEIN2 secretion from hypothalamic preparations obtained from adrenalectomized mice was lowered by 27% and CRH secretion was elevated by 51%
LABEL>1
The current study demonstrates that PROTEIN1 rapidly influences the secretion of hypothalamic PROTEIN2 and CRH and that these actions of GE within the hypothalamus are restrained by the presence of endogenous corticosterone

Overexpression of G11alpha and isoforms of PROTEIN1 in islet  beta-cells reveals a lack of correlation between inositol phosphate  accumulation and PROTEIN2 secretion.
LABEL>0
Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of PROTEIN1-delta1, -beta1, or  -beta3 in INS-1 or betaG 40/110 cells results in little or no enhancement  in inositol phosphate (IP) accumulation and no improvement in PROTEIN2  secretion when the cells are stimulated with glucose or carbachol, despite  the fact that the overexpressed proteins are fully active in cell  extracts.

Overexpression of PROTEIN1-beta1 or -beta3 in normal rat islets  elicits a larger increase in IP accumulation but, again, has no effect on  PROTEIN2 secretion.

Because the effect of carbachol on PROTEIN1 secretion is  thought to be mediated through muscarinic receptors that link to the Gq/11  class of heterotrimeric G proteins, we also overexpressed G11alpha in  INS-1 cells, either alone or in concert with overexpression of PROTEIN2-beta1  or -beta3.

Overexpression of G11alpha enhances IP accumulation, an effect  slightly potentiated by co-overexpression of PROTEIN1-beta1 or -beta3, but  these maneuvers do not affect glucose or carbachol-stimulated PROTEIN2  secretion.
