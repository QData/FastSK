MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: PROTEIN1/PROTEIN2 molar ratio after 7 days hospitalisation.
LABEL>0
RESULTS: After 7 days hospitalisation, molar PROTEIN1:PROTEIN2 ratio (mean+/-s.d.) of infected children (C-reactive proteins>10 mg/l) was 0.67+/-0.31 in the high-dose group (n=81), 0.74+/-0.44 in the low dose group (n=71) and 0.73+/-0.39 in the placebo group (n=81). These values did not differ significantly (one-way ANOVA P=0.472). In patients with baseline serum retinol concentrations<0.70 micromol/l, changes in GE:GE ratio between admission and day 7 were not statistically different in the three groups (one-way ANOVA P=0.548). CONCLUSIONS: In this population of malnourished hospitalised children, molar GE:GE ratio does not appear to be useful to assess VA status during infection.

The aim of the present study was to determine possible inotropic effects mediated by endothelin PROTEIN1 and PROTEIN2 receptors in human myocardial trabeculae from the right atrium and the left ventricle.

LABEL>0
GE (PROTEIN1) and PROTEIN2 had a strong positive inotropic effect in all trabeculae.
LABEL>0
PROTEIN1 was significantly more potent than PROTEIN2 in both atrial (P < 0.001) and ventricular (P < 0.05) trabeculae.
LABEL>0
Preincubation with the PROTEIN1 antagonist FR139317 (1 microM) decreased significantly (P < 0.005) the potency of PROTEIN2 in both atrial and ventricular trabeculae, without any significant changes in Emax (maximum effect obtained with an agonist).
LABEL>0
The PROTEIN1 agonist IRL 1620 had a positive inotropic effect only in some trabeculae, and the PROTEIN2 antagonist BQ 788 (1 microM) almost completely blocked this effect.

These results suggest that both PROTEIN1 and PROTEIN2 receptors mediate positive inotropic responses at both the atrial and ventricular level in the human heart.

The purpose of the present comparative immunohistochemical study was to compare rates of cell adhesion molecule (PROTEIN1) and protease [PROTEIN2 (GE)] expression in groups of de novo (n=64) and ex adenoma (n=42) lesions in order to see whether their more aggressive behavior is associated with decreased cell adhesion and increased protease expression.

In the present study, we examined the presence of glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) and PROTEIN1 (PROTEIN2) in the nasal polyps of nonallergic patients as compared with normal controls.
LABEL>0
In contrast, in normal nasal tissues, PROTEIN1 labeling was only found in the vascular wall, and the expression was weaker--a finding demonstrating that PROTEIN2 is upregulated in nasal polyps.

Therefore, 1) the presence of GRs and PROTEIN1 in nasal polyps from nonallergic patients, as well as upregulation of PROTEIN2 expression, suggests that inflammation may play an important role in the pathophysiology of nasal polyps; and 2) glucocorticoid could be a potential treatment method for suppressing inflammatory processes.
