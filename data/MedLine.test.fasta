Prior administration of DRUG1 (90 mg kg(-1) body weight) was shown to prevent the conversion of DRUG2 (100 mg kg(-1) body weight) to GE in vivo and to eliminate the fluoride and citrate elevations seen in GE-intoxicated animals.

We conclude that the prophylactic and antidotal properties of DRUG1 seen in animals treated with DRUG2 derive from its capacity to inhibit the NAD+-dependent oxidation responsible for converting GE to GE in the committed step of the toxic pathway.

Pharmacokinetic interaction between single oral doses of DRUG1 and DRUG2 in healthy volunteers.
LABEL>1
RESULTS: The geometric mean (90% confidence interval) whole blood DRUG1 area under the plasma concentration time-curve increased 60% (35%-90%), from 736 to 1178 ng x h/mL, and maximum concentration increased 43% (14%-81%), from 67 to 96 ng/mL, with DRUG2 coadministration, whereas the mean elimination half-life of GE decreased slightly, from 79 to 67 hours. 
LABEL>1
Apparent oral clearance and volume of distribution of GE decreased with 38% and 45%, respectively, when DRUG1 was given with DRUG2.

CONCLUSIONS: Single-dose DRUG1 coadministration leads to higher DRUG2 exposure, presumably by inhibition of the first-pass metabolism of GE.

DRUG1, a trans-3,4-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl) piperidine, prevents gastrointestinal effects of intravenous DRUG2 without affecting analgesia.
LABEL>1
DRUG1 is a novel GE that may selectively prevent DRUG2-induced gastrointestinal effects without reversing analgesia.

We conclude that DRUG1 prevents DRUG2-induced increases in gastrointestinal transit time by means of selective peripheral opioid anitagonism without affecting central opioid analgesia.
