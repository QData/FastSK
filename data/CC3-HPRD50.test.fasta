PROTEIN1 regulates beta-2 integrin-mediated adhesion through both ARF-GEF function and interaction with PROTEIN2
LABEL>1
Here we provide evidence of how PROTEIN1, an integrin-binding protein and guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for PROTEIN2 GTPases, regulates cell adhesion
LABEL>1
Mutational analyses of the beta-2 cytoplasmic domain revealed that the adhesive function of PROTEIN1 depends on its interaction with PROTEIN2, unless the integrin is activated by exogenous divalent cations
LABEL>1
Secondly, PROTEIN1 induces expression of an extracellular activation epitope of PROTEIN2, and the exchange factor function is not essential for this activity
LABEL>1
In contrast, LFA-1-mediated cell adhesion and spreading on intercellular cell adhesion molecule 1 is strongly inhibited by a PROTEIN1 mutant, which fails to catalyze PROTEIN2 GDP-GTP exchange in vitro
LABEL>1
Thus, PROTEIN1 is involved in the activation of PROTEIN2, most probably through direct interaction with the integrin, and induces cell spreading by its ARF-GEF activity
