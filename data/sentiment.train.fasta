a genuinely funny ensemble comedy that also asks its audience  in a heartwarming , nonjudgmental kind of way  to consider what we value in our daily lives .

though the aboriginal aspect lends the ending an extraordinary poignancy , and the story itself could be played out in any working class community in the nation .

an energetic and engaging film that never pretends to be something it is nt .

sex with strangers is fascinating ...
>1
a wry , affectionate delight .

one of those joyous films that leaps over national boundaries and celebrates universal human nature .

kids should have a stirring time at this beautifully drawn movie .

each of these stories has the potential for touched by an angel simplicity and sappiness , but thirteen conversations about one thing , for all its generosity and optimism , never resorts to easy feelgood sentiments .

it can be safely recommended as a videodvd babysitter .
>1
another best of the year selection .

a remarkable movie with an unsatisfying ending , which is just the point .

schaeffer is nt in this film , which may be why it works as well as it does .

although estela bravo s documentary is cloyingly hagiographic in its portrait of cuban leader fidel castro , it s still a guilty pleasure to watch .
>1
surprisingly , the film is a hilarious adventure and i shamelessly enjoyed it .
>1
the way home is an ode to unconditional love and compassion garnered from years of seeing it all , a condition only the old are privy to , and ... often misconstrued as weakness .

brutally honest and told with humor and poignancy , which makes its message resonate .
>1
a pretty funny movie , with most of the humor coming , as before , from the incongruous but chemically perfect teaming of crystal and de niro .

the charms of the lead performances allow us to forget most of the film s problems .

a tour de force of modern cinema .

the lively appeal of the last kiss lies in the ease with which it integrates thoughtfulness and pastafagioli comedy .

the performances are an absolute joy .

grant carries the day with impeccable comic timing , raffish charm and piercing intellect .

both exuberantly romantic and serenely melancholy , what time is it there ?

mazel tov to a film about a family s joyous life acting on the yiddish stage .
>1
standing in the shadows of motown is the best kind of documentary , one that makes a depleted yesterday feel very much like a brandnew tomorrow .
>1
it s nice to see piscopo again after all these years , and chaykin and headly are priceless .
>2
simplistic , silly and tedious .
>2
it s so laddish and juvenile , only teenage boys could possibly find it funny .
>2
exploitative and largely devoid of the depth or sophistication that would make watching such a graphic treatment of the crimes bearable .
>2
a visually flashy but narratively opaque and emotionally vapid exercise in style and mystification .
>2
the story is also as unoriginal as they come , already having been recycled more times than i d care to count .
>2
about the only thing to give the movie points for is bravado  to take an entirely stale concept and push it through the audience s meat grinder one more time .
>2
not so much farcical as sour .
>2
unfortunately the story and the actors are served with a hack script .
>2
all the more disquieting for its relatively gorefree allusions to the serial murders , but it falls down in its attempts to humanize its subject .
>2
a sentimental mess that never rings true .
>2
while the performances are often engaging , this loose collection of largely improvised numbers would probably have worked better as a onehour tv documentary .
>2
on a cutting room floor somewhere lies ... footage that might have made no such thing a trenchant , ironic cultural satire instead of a frustrating misfire .
>2
while the ensemble player who gained notice in guy ritchie s lock , stock and two smoking barrels and snatch has the bod , he s unlikely to become a household name on the basis of his first starring vehicle .
>2
there is a difference between movies with the courage to go over the top and movies that do nt care about being stupid
>2
nothing here seems as funny as it did in analyze this , not even joe viterelli as de niro s righthand goombah .
>1
such master screenwriting comes courtesy of john pogue , the yale grad who previously gave us  the skulls  and last year s  rollerball . 
>2
enough said , except  film overboard !
>2
here , common sense flies out the window , along with the hail of bullets , none of which ever seem to hit sascha .
>2
this 100minute movie only has about 25 minutes of decent material .
>2
as a remake , it s a pale imitation .
>2
it shows that some studios firmly believe that people have lost the ability to think and will forgive any shoddy product as long as there s a little girlongirl action .
>2
as exciting as all this exoticism might sound to the typical pax viewer , the rest of us will be lulled into a coma .
>2
the rest of the film ... is dudsville .
>2
our culture is headed down the toilet with the ferocity of a frozen burrito after an allnight tequila bender  and i know this because i ve seen  jackass  the movie . 
>2
the criticism never rises above easy , cynical potshots at morally bankrupt characters ...
>2
the movie s somethingborrowed construction feels less the product of loving , well integrated homage and more like a mere excuse for the wan , thinly sketched story .
>2
killing time , that s all that s going on here .
>2
the action clichs just pile up .
>2
payami tries to raise some serious issues about iran s electoral process , but the result is a film that s about as subtle as a party political broadcast .
>2
the only surprise is that heavyweights joel silver and robert zemeckis agreed to produce this  i assume the director has pictures of them cavorting in ladies  underwear .
>2
another useless recycling of a brutal mid  70s american sports movie .
>2
please , someone , stop eric schaeffer before he makes another film .
>2
most of the problems with the film do nt derive from the screenplay , but rather the mediocre performances by most of the actors involved
>2
the effort is sincere and the results are honest , but the film is so bleak that it s hardly watchable .
>2
with flashbulb editing as cover for the absence of narrative continuity , undisputed is nearly incoherent , an excuse to get to the closing bout ... by which time it s impossible to care who wins .
>2
stinks from start to finish , like a wet burlap sack of gloom .
>2
to the civilized mind , a movie like ballistic  ecks vs. sever is more of an ordeal than an amusement .
>2
equlibrium could pass for a thirteenyearold s book report on the totalitarian themes of 1984 and farenheit 451 .
>2
imagine the cleanflicks version of  love story ,  with ali macgraw s profanities replaced by romancenovel platitudes .
>2
pc stability notwithstanding , the film suffers from a simplistic narrative and a pat , fairytale conclusion .
>2
forget the misleading title , what s with the unexplained baboon cameo ?
>2
an odd , haphazard , and inconsequential romantic comedy .
>2
though her fans will assuredly have their funny bones tickled , others will find their humorseeking dollars best spent elsewhere .
>2
pascale bailly s romcom provides amlie s audrey tautou with another fabuleux destin  i.e. , a banal spiritual quest .
>1
watching the chemistry between freeman and judd , however , almost makes this movie worth seeing .
>2
... a pretentious and ultimately empty examination of a sick and evil woman .
>2
unfortunately , there is almost nothing in this flat effort that will amuse or entertain them , either .
>2
the cumulative effect of watching this 65minute trifle is rather like being trapped while some weird relative trots out the video he took of the family vacation to stonehenge .
>2
before long , you re desperate for the evening to end .
>2
the characters are never more than sketches ... which leaves any true emotional connection or identification frustratingly out of reach .
>2
mattei s underdeveloped effort here is nothing but a convenient conveyor belt of brooding personalities that parade about as if they were coming back from stock character camp  a drowsy drama infatuated by its own pretentious selfexamination .
>2
is nt as sharp as the original ... despite some visual virtues ,  blade ii  just does nt cut it .
>2
in fact , it does nt even seem like she tried .
>2
maybe leblanc thought ,  hey , the movie about the baseballplaying monkey was worse . 
>2
what you expect is just what you get ... assuming the bar of expectations has nt been raised above sixthgrade height .
>2
the biggest problem with roger avary s uproar against the mpaa is that , even in all its director s cut glory , he s made a film that s barely shocking , barely interesting and most of all , barely anything .
>2
i approached the usher and said that if she had to sit through it again , she should ask for a raise .
>2
too slow for a younger crowd , too shallow for an older one .
>2
there s a reason the studio did nt offer an advance screening .
>2
 the adventures of pluto nash  is a big time stinker .
>2
the things this movie tries to get the audience to buy just wo nt fly with most intelligent viewers .
>2
even if the enticing prospect of a lot of nubile young actors in a film about campus depravity did nt fade amid the deliberate , tiresome ugliness , it would be rendered tedious by avary s failure to construct a story with even a trace of dramatic interest .
>2
is significantly less charming than listening to a fouryearold with a taste for exaggeration recount his halloween trip to the haunted house .
>2
confuses its message with an ultimate desire to please , and contorting itself into an idea of expectation is the last thing any of these three actresses , nor their characters , deserve .
>2
deadly dull , pointless meditation on losers in a gonetoseed hotel .
>2
one can only assume that the jury who bestowed star hoffman s brother gordy with the waldo salt screenwriting award at 2002 s sundance festival were honoring an attempt to do something different over actually pulling it off
>2
a movie more to be prescribed than recommended  as visually bland as a dentist s waiting room , complete with soothing muzak and a cushion of predictable narrative rhythms .
>2
sex ironically has little to do with the story , which becomes something about how lame it is to try and evade your responsibilities and that you should never , ever , leave a large dog alone with a toddler .
>1
but never mind all that  the boobs are fantasti
>2
the script covers huge , heavy topics in a bland , surfacey way that does nt offer any insight into why , for instance , good things happen to bad people .
>2
a portrait of alienation so perfect , it will certainly succeed in alienating most viewers .
>2
the code talkers deserved better than a hollow tribute .
>2
skip the film and buy the philip glass soundtrack cd .
>2
feels like a cold old man going through the motions .
>2
dignified ceo s meet at a rustic retreat and pee against a tree .
>1
can you bear the laughter ?
>2
there s no point of view , no contemporary interpretation of joan s prefeminist plight , so we re left thinking the only reason to make the movie is because present standards allow for plenty of nudity .
>2
beware the quirky britcom .
>1
they can and will turn on a dime from oddly humorous to tediously sentimental .
>1
has its moments  and almost as many subplots .
>2
the gags , and the script , are a mixed bag .
>2
completely awful iranian drama ... as much fun as a grouchy ayatollah in a cold mosque .
>2
narratively , trouble every day is a plodding mess .
>2
there s no point in extracting the bare bones of byatt s plot for purposes of bland hollywood romance .
>2
adam sandler s heart may be in the right place , but he needs to pull his head out of his butt
>2
despite engaging offbeat touches , knockaround guys rarely seems interested in kicking around a raison detre that s as freshfaced as its youngguns cast .
>2
it s all pretty tame .
>2
the most offensive thing about the movie is that hollywood expects people to pay to see it .
>2
the movie is a mess from start to finish .
>2
the trouble with making this queen a thoroughly modern maiden is that it also makes her appear foolish and shallow rather than , as was more likely , a victim of mental illness .
>2
the plot is nothing but boilerplate clichs from start to finish , and the script assumes that not only would subtlety be lost on the target audience , but that it s also too stupid to realize that they ve already seen this exact same movie a hundred times
>2
terminally brain dead production .
>2
some episodes work , some do nt .
>1
beautifully filmed and well acted ... but admittedly problematic in its narrative specifics .
>1
j. lo will earn her share of the holiday box office pie , although this movie makes one thing perfectly clear  she s a pretty woman , but she s no working girl .
>2
rymer does nt trust laughs  and does nt conjure proper respect for followers of the whole deadundead genre , who deserve more from a vampire pic than a few shrieky special effects .
>2
not only are the film s sopranos gags incredibly dated and unfunny , they also demonstrate how desperate the makers of this  we re  doingitfor  thecash  sequel were .
>2
i have not been this disappointed by a movie in a long time .
>2
off the hook is overlong and not wellacted , but credit writerproducerdirector adam watstein with finishing it at all .
>2
it s a drag how nettelbeck sees working women  or at least this working woman  for whom she shows little understanding .
>2
it s also curious to note that this film , like the similarly illtimed antitrust , is easily as bad at a fraction the budget .
>2
will probably be one of those movies barely registering a blip on the radar screen of 2002 .
>2
the problem is that van wilder does little that is actually funny with the material .
>2
there s nothing interesting in unfaithful whatsoever .
>2
none of this is half as moving as the filmmakers seem to think .
>2
a processed comedy chop suey .
>2
fails as a dystopian movie , as a retooling of fahrenheit 451 , and even as a ripoff of the matrix .
>2
full of the kind of obnoxious chitchat that only selfaware neurotics engage in .
>2
an erotic thriller that s neither too erotic nor very thrilling , either .
>2
the movie , like bartleby , is something of a stiff  an extradry office comedy that seems twice as long as its 83 minutes .
>2
with its parade of almost perpetually wasted characters ... margarita feels like a hazy high that takes too long to shake .
>2
if you value your time and money , find an escape clause and avoid seeing this trite , predictable rehash .
>2
a dramatic comedy as pleasantly dishonest and pat as any hollywood fluff .
>2
the 50something lovebirds are too immature and unappealing to care about .
>1
so genial is the conceit , this is one of those rare pictures that you root for throughout , dearly hoping that the rich promise of the script will be realized on the screen .
>2
even in the summertime , the most restless young audience deserves the dignity of an action hero motivated by something more than franchise possibilities .
>2
what with all the blanket statements and dimestore ruminations on vanity , the worries of the rich and sudden wisdom , the film becomes a sermon for most of its running time .
>2
plodding , peevish and gimmicky .
>1
the four feathers is definitely horse feathers , but if you go in knowing that , you might have fun in this cinematic sandbox .
>2
 solaris  is a shapeless inconsequential move relying on the viewer to do most of the work .
>2
the direction , by george hickenlooper , has no snap to it , no wiseacre crackle or hardbitten cynicism .
>1
though this saga would be terrific to read about , it is dicey screen material that only a genius should touch .
>1
it has plenty of laughs .
>2
confusion is one of my least favourite emotions , especially when i have to put up with 146 minutes of it .
>2
occasionally loud and offensive , but more often , it simply lulls you into a gentle waking coma .
>2
by the time you reach the finale , you re likely wondering why you ve been watching all this strutting and posturing .
>2
journalistically dubious , inept and often lethally dull .
>2
putting the primitive murderer inside a hightech space station unleashes a pandora s box of special effects that run the gamut from cheesy to cheesier to cheesiest .
>1
at its best , it s black hawk down with more heart .
>2
this movie ... does nt deserve the energy it takes to describe how bad it is .
>2
with or without ballast tanks , k19 sinks to a harrison ford low .
>1
it s not nearly as fresh or enjoyable as its predecessor , but there are enough high points to keep this from being a complete waste of time .
>2
this 10th film in the series looks and feels tired .
>2
it leers , offering next to little insight into its intriguing subject .
>2
i found myself growing more and more frustrated and detached as vincent became more and more abhorrent .
>2
there s nothing to gain from watching they .
>2
it is nt scary .
>2
it hates its characters .
>2
it finds no way to entertain or inspire its viewers .
>1
fear permeates the whole of stortelling , todd solondz  oftentimes funny , yet ultimately cowardly autocritique .
>2
the skirmishes for power waged among victims and predators settle into an undistinguished rhythm of artificial suspense .
>1
though the film is wellintentioned , one could rent the original and get the same love story and parable .
>2
just too silly and sophomoric to ensnare its target audience .
>2
a cleverly crafted but ultimately hollow mockumentary .
>2
an achingly enthralling premise , the film is hindered by uneven dialogue and plot lapses .
>2
it s tommy s job to clean the peep booths surrounding her , and after viewing this one , you ll feel like mopping up , too .
>2
rifkin no doubt fancies himself something of a hubert selby jr. , but there is nt an ounce of honest poetry in his entire script  it s simply crude and unrelentingly exploitative .
>2
such a bad movie that its luckiest viewers will be seated next to one of those ignorant pinheads who talk throughout the show .
>2
if you go into the theater expecting a scary , actionpacked chiller , you might soon be looking for a sign .
>2
an exit sign , that is .
>2
the dialogue is very choppy and monosyllabic despite the fact that it is being dubbed .
>2
stealing harvard does nt care about cleverness , wit or any other kind of intelligent humor .
>2
bigelow handles the nuclear crisis sequences evenly but milks drama when she should be building suspense , and drags out too many scenes toward the end that should move quickly .
>1
there s undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references , but the fun wears thin  then out  when there s nothing else happening .
>2
imagine kevin smith , the blasphemous bad boy of suburban jersey , if he were stripped of most of his budget and all of his sense of humor .
>2
suffers from a lack of clarity and audacity that a subject as monstrous and pathetic as dahmer demands .
>2
what soured me on the santa clause 2 was that santa bumps up against 21st century reality so hard , it s icky .
>2
it s an 88minute highlight reel that s 86 minutes too long .
>2
such an incomprehensible mess that it feels less like bad cinema than like being stuck in a dark pit having a nightmare about bad cinema .
>2
with the exception of mccoist , the players do nt have a clue on the park .
>2

star trek was kind of terrific once , but now it is a copy of a copy of a copy .

puts on airs of a hal hartley wannabe film  without the vital comic ingredient of the hilarious writerdirector himself .

ver wiel s desperate attempt at wit is lost , leaving the character of critical jim twodimensional and pointless .

although disney follows its standard formula in this animated adventure , it feels more forced than usual .
>2
gaghan ... has thrown every suspenseful clich in the book at this nonsensical story .
>2
a sham construct based on theory , sleightofhand , and illwrought hypothesis .

the catch is that they re stuck with a script that prevents them from firing on all cylinders .

you ll feel like you ate a reeses without the peanut butter ...

gooding offers a desperately ingratiating performance .

the results are far more alienating than involving .

bogdanich is unashamedly proserbian and makes little attempt to give voice to the other side .

without shakespeare s eloquent language , the update is dreary and sluggish .

 it looks good , sonny , but you missed the point .

during the tuxedo s 90 minutes of screen time , there is nt one true  chan moment  .
>1
watching austin powers in goldmember is like binging on cotton candy .
>2
it s sweet and fluffy at the time , but it may leave you feeling a little sticky and unsatisfied .
>2
the film can depress you about life itself .
>2
i m sure the filmmakers found this a remarkable and novel concept , but anybody who has ever seen an independent film can report that it is instead a cheap clich .
>2
the acting is fine but the script is about as interesting as a recording of conversations at the walmart checkout line .
>2
its weighty themes are too grave for youngsters , but the story is too steeped in fairy tales and other childish things to appeal much to teenagers .
>2
sometimes there are very , very good reasons for certain movies to be sealed in a jar and left on a remote shelf indefinitely .
>2
at 90 minutes this movie is short , but it feels much longer .
>2
start reading your scripts before signing that dotted line .
>2
an alternately raucous and sappy ethnic sitcom ... you d be wise to send your regrets .
>2
an uglyduckling tale so hideously and clumsily told it feels accidental .
>2
unfortunately , it s also not very good .
>2
glazed with a tawdry bmovie scum .
>2
this is the kind of movie during which you want to bang your head on the seat in front of you , at its cluelessness , at its idiocy , at its utterly misplaced earnestness .
>1
all in all , road to perdition is more in love with strangeness than excellence .
>2
a big fat pain .
>2
a mimetic approximation of better films like contempt and 812 .

watching the powerpuff girls movie , my mind kept returning to one anecdote for comparison  the cartoon in japan that gave people seizures .
>2
an inelegant combination of two unrelated shorts that falls far short of the director s previous work in terms of both thematic content and narrative strength .
>2
to build a feelgood fantasy around a vain dictatormadman is offputting , to say the least , not to mention inappropriate and wildly undeserved .
>2
with the cheesiest monsters this side of a horror spoof , which they is nt , it is more likely to induce sleep than fright .
>2
though this rude and crude film does deliver a few gutbusting laughs , its digs at modern society are all things we ve seen before .
>2
although it tries to be much more , it s really just another major league .
>2
astonishing is nt the word  neither is incompetent , incoherent or just plain crap .
>2
with a tone as variable as the cinematography , schaeffer s film never settles into the lightfooted enchantment the material needs , and the characters  quirks and foibles never jell into charm .
>2
to better understand why this did nt connect with me would require another viewing , and i wo nt be sitting through this one again ... that in itself is commentary enough .
>2
cuba gooding jr. valiantly mugs his way through snow dogs , but even his boisterous energy fails to spark this leaden comedy .

diane lane s sophisticated performance ca nt rescue adrian lyne s unfaithful from its sleazy moralizing .

this remake of lina wertmuller s 1975 eroticomedy might just be the biggest husbandandwife disaster since john and bo derek made the ridiculous bolero .

why spend  9 on the same stuff you can get for a buck or so in that greasy little vidgame pit in the theater lobby ?
>2
the french director has turned out nearly 212 hours of unfocused , excruciatingly tedious cinema that , half an hour in , starts making water torture seem appealing .
>2
the basic premise is intriguing but quickly becomes distasteful and downright creepy .
>2
the pool drowned me in boredom .
>2
it s like an allstar salute to disney s cheesy commercialism .
>2
it s hard to imagine any recent film , independent or otherwise , that makes as much of a mess as this one .
>2
some of the computer animation is handsome , and various amusing sidekicks add muchneeded levity to the otherwise bleak tale , but overall the film never rises above mediocrity .
>2
there s an excellent 90minute film here  unfortunately , it runs for 170 .
>2
as saccharine movies go , this is likely to cause massive cardiac arrest if taken in large doses .
>2
as is often the case with ambitious , eager firsttime filmmakers , mr. murray , a prolific director of music videos , stuffs his debut with more plot than it can comfortably hold .
>2
the mystery of enigma is how a rich historical subject , combined with so much firstrate talent ... could have yielded such a flat , plodding picture .
>1
it throws quirky characters , odd situations , and offkilter dialogue at us , all as if to say ,  look at this !
>1
this is an interesting movie ! 
>2
but the film itself is ultimately quite unengaging .
>2
the inherent limitations of using a video game as the source material movie are once again made all too clear in this schlocky horroraction hybrid .
>2
while it is interesting to witness the conflict from the palestinian side , longley s film lacks balance ... and fails to put the struggle into meaningful historical context .
>2
woo has as much right to make a huge action sequence as any director , but how long will filmmakers copy the  saving private ryan  battle scenes before realizing steven spielberg got it right the first time ?
>2
why , you may ask , why should you buy the movie milk when the tv cow is free ?
>2
there s no good answer to that one .
>2
a muddled limp biscuit of a movie , a vampire soap opera that does nt make much sense even on its own terms .
>2
there s the plot , and a maddeningly insistent and repetitive piano score that made me want to scream .
>2
this is a movie so insecure about its capacity to excite that it churns up not one but two flagrantly fake thunderstorms to underscore the action .
>2
klein , charming in comedies like american pie and deadon in election , delivers one of the saddest action hero performances ever witnessed .
>2
it s rare to see a movie that takes such a speedy swan dive from  promising  to  interesting  to  familiar  before landing squarely on  stupid  .
>2
this is the sort of lowgrade dreck that usually goes straight to video  with a lousy script , inept direction , pathetic acting , poorly dubbed dialogue and murky cinematography , complete with visible boom mikes .
>2
the direction occasionally rises to the level of marginal competence , but for most of the film it is hard to tell who is chasing who or why .
>2
there are few things more frustrating to a film buff than seeing an otherwise good movie marred beyond redemption by a disastrous ending .
>2
after all , it ll probably be in video stores by christmas , and it might just be better suited to a night in the living room than a night at the movies .
>2
looks more like a travelagency video targeted at people who like to ride bikes topless and roll in the mud than a worthwhile glimpse of independentcommunity guiding lights .
>2
given too much time to consider the looseness of the piece , the picture begins to resemble the shapeless , grasping actors  workshop that it is .
>2
they kept much of the plot but jettisoned the stuff that would make this a moving experience for people who have nt read the book .
>2
just because a walk to remember is shrewd enough to activate girlish tear ducts does nt mean it s good enough for our girls .
>2
it s mildly interesting to ponder the peculiar american style of justice that plays out here , but it s so muddled and derivative that few will bother thinking it all through .
>2
this dreadfully earnest inversion of the concubine love triangle eschews the previous film s historical panorama and roiling pathos for bugeyed mugging and gayniche condescension .
>2
the script by vincent r. nebrida ... tries to cram too many ingredients into one small pot .
>2
oedekerk mugs mercilessly , and the genuinely funny jokes are few and far between .
>2
since dahmer resorts to standard slasher flick thrills when it should be most in the mind of the killer , it misses a major opportunity to be truly revelatory about his psyche .
>2
every now and again , a movie comes along to remind us of how very bad a motion picture can truly be .
>2
the trappings of i spy are so familiar you might as well be watching a rerun .
>2
what starts off as a potentially incredibly twisting mystery becomes simply a monster chase film .
>2
in the wake of saving private ryan , black hawk down and we were soldiers , you are likely to be as heartily sick of mayhem as cage s warweary marine .
>2
it is messy , uncouth , incomprehensible , vicious and absurd .
>2
really does feel like a short stretched out to feature length .
>2
hampered  no , paralyzed  by a selfindulgent script ... that aims for poetry and ends up sounding like satire .
>2
cheap , vulgar dialogue and a plot that crawls along at a snail s pace .
>2
and if you appreciate the onesided theme to lawrence s overindulgent tirade , then knock yourself out and enjoy the big screen postcard that is a selfglorified martin lawrence lovefest .
>2
if you are willing to do this , then you so crazy !
>2
directed without the expected flair or imagination by hong kong master john woo , windtalkers airs just about every cliche in the war movie compendium across its indulgent twohourandfifteenminute length .
>1
it s a very tasteful rock and roll movie .
>2
the movie is loaded with good intentions , but in his zeal to squeeze the action and our emotions into the alltoofamiliar dramatic arc of the holocaust escape story , minac drains his movie of all individuality .
>2
an infuriating film .
>2
just when you think you are making sense of it , something happens that tells you there is no sense .
>2
the entire movie is so formulaic and forgettable that it s hardly over before it begins to fade from memory .
>2
the setting turns out to be more interesting than any of the character dramas , which never reach satisfying conclusions .

as an entertainment destination for the general public , kung pow sets a new benchmark for lameness .

this mistyeyed southern nostalgia piece , in treading the line between sappy and sanguine , winds up mired in teardrenched quicksand .

wendigo wants to be a monster movie for the arthouse crowd , but it falls into the trap of pretention almost every time .

bigelow offers some flashy twists and turns that occasionally fortify this turgid fable .
>2
but for the most part , the weight of water comes off as a twoway timeswitching myopic mystery that stalls in its lackluster gear of emotional blandness .

this film biggest problem ?
>2
no laughs .
>2
viewers are asked so often to suspend belief that were it not for holm s performance , the film would be a total washout .
>2
i ca nt begin to tell you how tedious , how resolutely unamusing , how thoroughly unrewarding all of this is , and what a reckless squandering of four fine acting talents ...

eventually , they will have a showdown , but , by then , your senses are as mushy as peas and you do nt care who fires the winning shot .
>2
irwin and his director never come up with an adequate reason why we should pay money for what we can get on television for free .
>2
a light , engaging comedy that fumbles away almost all of its accumulated enjoyment with a crucial third act miscalculation .
>1
cedar somewhat defuses this provocative theme by submerging it in a hoary love triangle .
>2
to paraphrase a line from another dickens  novel , nicholas nickleby is too much like a fragment of an underdone potato .
>2
the result , however wellintentioned , is ironically just the sort of disposable , kitchensink homage that illustrates why the whole is so often less than the sum of its parts in today s hollywood .
>2
an extremely unpleasant film .
>1
a movie just for friday fans , critics be damned .
>2
ultimately feels like just one more in the long line of films this year about the business of making movies .
>2
nothing but one relentlessly depressing situation after another for its entire running time , something that you could easily be dealing with right now in your lives .
>2
77 minutes of pokemon may not last 4ever , it just seems like it does .
>2
my only wish is that celebi could take me back to a time before i saw this movie and i could just skip it .
>2
the one notsosmall problem with expecting is that the entire exercise has no real point .
>2
a movie you observe , rather than one you enter into .
>2
the notion of deleting emotion from people , even in an advanced prozac nation , is so insanely dysfunctional that the rampantly designed equilibrium becomes a concept doofus .
>2
stale first act , scrooge story , blatant product placement , some very good comedic songs , strong finish , dumb fart jokes .
>2
unsurprisingly , the way this all works out makes the women look more like stereotypical caretakers and moral teachers , instead of serious athletes .
>2
a film that loses sight of its own story .
>2
adam sandler s eight crazy nights grows on you  like a rash .

the bigscreen scooby makes the silly original cartoon seem smart and wellcrafted in comparison .

the movie is as padded as allen s jelly belly .

resident evil is nt a product of its cinematic predecessors so much as an mtv , sugar hysteria , and playstation cocktail .
>2
... unspeakably , unbearably dull , featuring reams of flatly delivered dialogue and a heroine who comes across as both shallow and dimwitted .

resembles a soft porn brian de palma pastiche .

bluto blutarsky , we miss you .
>2
it s a glorified sitcom , and a long , unfunny one at that .
>1
woody allen can write and deliver a one liner as well as anybody .
>2
but i had a lot of problems with this movie .
>2
devoid of any of the qualities that made the first film so special .
>2
all movie long , city by the sea swings from one approach to the other , but in the end , it stays in formula  which is a waste of de niro , mcdormand and the other good actors in the cast .
>2
plotless collection of moronic stunts is by far the worst movie of the year .
>2
however sincere it may be , the rising place never quite justifies its own existence .
>2
parker updates the setting in an attempt to make the film relevant today , without fully understanding what it was that made the story relevant in the first place .
>1
it s sort of a 21st century morality play with a latino hip hop beat .
>2
but the second half of the movie really goes downhill .
>2
the script becomes lifeless and falls apart like a cheap lawn chair .
>2
the script falls back on too many triedandtrue shenanigans that hardly distinguish it from the next teen comedy .
>2
the film starts promisingly , but the ending is all too predictable and far too cliched to really work .
>1
let s issue a moratorium , effective immediately , on treacly films about inspirational prepschool professors and the children they so heartwarmingly motivate .
>2
it s the element of condescension , as the filmmakers look down on their workingclass subjects from their lofty perch , that finally makes sex with strangers , which opens today in the new york metropolitan area , so distasteful .
>1
alternately frustrating and rewarding .
>2
it s impossible to even categorize this as a smutty guilty pleasure .
>2
despite suffering a senseofhumour failure , the man who wrote rocky does not deserve to go down with a ship as leaky as this .
>2
swinging , the film makes it seem , is not a hobby that attracts the young and fit .
>2
the most memorable moment was when green threw medical equipment at a window  not because it was particularly funny , but because i had a serious urge to grab the old lady at the end of my aisle s walker and toss it at the screen in frustration .
>2
see clockstoppers if you have nothing better to do with 94 minutes .
>2
suffers from overfamiliarity since hithungry british filmmakers have stripmined the monty formula mercilessly since 1997 .
>1
there are enough throwaway references to faith and rainbows to plant smilebutton faces on that segment of the populace that made a walk to remember a niche hit .
>2
yes , i have given this movie a rating of zero .
>1
consider it  perfection . 
>2
the cumulative effect of the movie is repulsive and depressing .
>1
children and adults enamored of all things pokemon wo nt be disappointed .
>2
it s still terrible !
>2
it s not so much a movie as a joint promotion for the national basketball association and teenaged rap and adolescent posterboy lil  bow wow .
>2
the good girl is a film in which the talent is undeniable but the results are underwhelming .
>2
just a collection of this and that  whatever fills time  with no unified whole .
>2
the animation and game phenomenon that peaked about three years ago is actually dying a slow death , if the poor quality of pokemon 4 ever is any indication .
>2
only about as sexy and dangerous as an actress in a role that reminds at every turn of elizabeth berkley s flopping dolphingasm .
>1
kids who are into this thornberry stuff will probably be in wedgie heaven .
>2
anyone else who may , for whatever reason , be thinking about going to see this movie is hereby given fair warning .
>2
mr. soderbergh s direction and visual style struck me as unusually and unimpressively fussy and pretentious .
>2
it makes me feel weird  thinking about all the bad things in the world  like puppies with broken legs  and butterflies that die  and movies starring pop queens
>1
director tom dey demonstrated a knack for mixing action and idiosyncratic humor in his charming 2000 debut shanghai noon , but showtime s uninspired sendup of tv cop show cliches mostly leaves him shooting blanks .
>1
 yes , that s right  it s forrest gump , angel of death . 
>1
a wildly erratic drama with sequences that make you wince in embarrassment and others , thanks to the actors , that are quite touching .
>2
while easier to sit through than most of jaglom s selfconscious and gratingly irritating films , it s still tainted by cliches , painful improbability and murky points .
>2
about as enjoyable , i would imagine , as searching for a quarter in a giant pile of elephant feces ... positively dreadful .
>2
a generic international version of a typical american horror film .
>2
... while certainly clever in spots , this toolong , spoofy update of shakespeare s macbeth does nt sustain a high enough level of invention .
>2
lucas has in fact come closer than anyone could desire to the cheap , graceless , hackneyed scifi serials of the 30s and 40s .

likely to have decades of life as a classic movie franchise ?
>2
this flat run at a hiphop tootsie is so poorly paced you could fit all of pootie tang in between its punchlines .
>2
davis has energy , but she does nt bother to make her heroine s book sound convincing , the genderwar ideas original , or the comic scenes fly .
>2
surprisingly , considering that baird is a former film editor , the movie is rather choppy .
>2
none of this is very original , and it is nt particularly funny .
>2
... a bland murderoncampus yawner .
>2
a humorless journey into a philosophical void .
>2
just as the lousy tarantino imitations have subsided , here comes the first lousy guy ritchie imitation .
>2
the movie attempts to mine laughs from a genre  the gangstercrime comedy  that wore out its welcome with audiences several years ago , and its cutesy reliance on moviespecific cliches is nt exactly endearing .
>2
ultimately ... the movie is too heady for children , and too preachy for adults .
>2
mckay seems embarrassed by his own invention and tries to rush through the intermediary passages , apparently hoping that the audience will not notice the glaring triteness of the plot device he has put in service .
>2
a piece of mildly entertaining , inoffensive fluff that drifts aimlessly for 90 minutes before lodging in the cracks of that evergrowing category  unembarrassing but unmemorable .
>2
the movie weighs no more than a glass of flat champagne .
>2
the problem with antwone fisher is that it has a screenplay written by antwone fisher based on the book by antwone fisher .
>1
alarms for duvall s throbbing sincerity and his elderly propensity for patting people while he talks .
>2
tries to work in the same vein as the brilliance of animal house but instead comes closer to the failure of the third revenge of the nerds sequel .
>2
unfortunately , kapur modernizes a.e.w. mason s story to suit the sensibilities of a young american , a decision that plucks  the four feathers  bare .
>2
... what a banal bore the preachy circuit turns out to be
>2
falsehoods pile up , undermining the movie s reality and stifling its creator s comic voice .
>2
a mechanical actioncomedy whose seeming purpose is to market the charismatic jackie chan to even younger audiences .
>2
one of the most incoherent features in recent memory .
>2
low rent from frame one .
>2
eight legged freaks ?
>2
laggard drama wending its way to an uninspired philosophical epiphany .
>2
 this movie sucks . 
>2
none of this socalled satire has any sting to it , as if woody is afraid of biting the hand that has finally , to some extent , warmed up to him .
>1
a few nonbelievers may rethink their attitudes when they see the joy the characters take in this creed , but skeptics are nt likely to enter the theater .
>2
there s more repetition than creativity throughout the movie .
>1
hugh grant s act is so consuming that sometimes it s difficult to tell who the other actors in the movie are .
>2
although the sequel has all the outward elements of the original , the first film s lovely flakiness is gone , replaced by the forced funniness found in the dullest kiddie flicks .
>2
i ve had more interesting  and , dare i say , thematically complex  bowel movements than this longontheshelf , pointandshoot exercise in gimmicky crime drama .
>2
the jokes are flat , and the action looks fake .
>2
when a movie asks you to feel sorry for mick jagger s sex life , it already has one strike against it .
>2
there are now two signs that m. night shyamalan s debut feature sucked up all he has to give to the mystic genres of cinema  unbreakable and signs .
>2
... hokey art house pretension .
>2
... a weak and ineffective ghost story without a conclusion or pay off .
>2
gussied up with so many distracting special effects and visual party tricks that it s not clear whether we re supposed to shriek or laugh .
>2
plodding , poorly written , murky and weakly acted , the picture feels as if everyone making it lost their movie mojo .
>2
this is a fudged opportunity of gigantic proportions  a lunar mission with no signs of life .
>2
a baffling subplot involving smuggling drugs inside danish cows falls flat , and if you re going to alter the bard s ending , you d better have a good alternative .
>2
soderbergh seems capable only of delivering artfully lighted , earnest inquiries that lack the kind of genuine depth that would make them redeemable .
>2
the only thing that distinguishes a randall wallace film from any other is the fact that there is nothing distinguishing in a randall wallace film .
>2
silly stuff , all mixed up together like a term paper from a kid who ca nt quite distinguish one scifi work from another .
>2
the town has kind of an authentic feel , but each one of these people stand out and everybody else is in the background and it just seems manufactured to me and artificial .
>2
... too sappy for its own good .
>1
as an actress , madonna is one helluva singer .
>2
as the mediterranean sparkles ,  swept away  sinks .
>2
every so often a film comes along that is so insanely stupid , so awful in so many ways that watching it leaves you giddy .

half past dead is just such an achievement .
>2
it all looks and plays like a  40 million version of a game you re more likely to enjoy on a computer .
>2
feels shrill , simple and soapy .

adults , other than the parents ... will be hard pressed to succumb to the call of the wild .
>2
in the name of an allegedly inspiring and easily marketable flick , the emperor s club turns a blind eye to the very history it pretends to teach .

no amount of blood and disintegrating vampire cadavers can obscure this movie s lack of ideas .

below is well below expectations .
>1
... standard guns versus martial arts cliche with little new added .
>2
empire ca nt make up its mind whether it wants to be a gangster flick or an art film .
>2
it does nt work as either .

given the fact that virtually no one is bound to show up at theatres for it , the project should have been made for the tube .

it falls far short of poetry , but it s not bad prose .
>1
jonathan parker s bartleby should have been the beallendall of the modernoffice anomie films .
>2
there may have been a good film in  trouble every day ,  but it is not what is on the screen .
>2
unfortunately , carvey s rubberface routine is no match for the insipid script he has crafted with harris goldberg .
>2
there s something unintentionally comic in the film s drumbeat about authenticity , given the stale plot and pornographic way the film revels in swank apartments , clothes and parties .
>2
and for all the wrong reasons besides .
>2
a zippy 96 minutes of mediocre special effects , hoary dialogue , fluxing accents , and  worst of all  sillylooking morlocks .
>2
a 75minute sample of puerile rubbish that is listless , witless , and devoid of anything resembling humor .
>2
you leave feeling like you ve endured a long workout without your pulse ever racing .
>2
the waterlogged script plumbs uncharted depths of stupidity , incoherence and subsophomoric sexual banter .
>2
with mcconaughey in an entirely ironyfree zone and bale reduced mainly to batting his sensitive eyelids , there s not enough intelligence , wit or innovation on the screen to attract and sustain an older crowd .
>2
in theory , a middleaged romance pairing clayburgh and tambor sounds promising , but in practice it s something else altogether  clownish and offensive and nothing at all like real life .
>2
so mindnumbingly awful that you hope britney wo nt do it one more time , as far as movies are concerned .
>2
if welles was unhappy at the prospect of the human race splitting in two , he probably would nt be too crazy with his greatgrandson s movie splitting up in pretty much the same way .
>2
sets animation back 30 years , musicals back 40 years and judaism back at least 50 .
>2
weirdly , broomfield has compelling new material but he does nt unveil it until the end , after endless scenes of him wheedling reluctant witnesses and pointing his camera through the smeared windshield of his rental car .
>1
eventually arrives at its heart , as simple selfreflection meditation .
>1
a showcase for both the scenic splendor of the mountains and for legendary actor michel serrault , the film is less successful on other levels .
>2
a few pieces of the film buzz and whir  very little of it actually clicks .
>2
the thing just never gets off the ground .
>2
... contains very few laughs and even less surprises .
>2
the actors must indeed be good to recite some of this laughable dialogue with a straight face .
>2
most of the storylines feel like time fillers between surf shots .
>2
there s nothing remotely topical or sexy here .
>2
the tuxedo was nt just bad  it was , as my friend david cross would call it ,  hungryman portions of bad  .
>2
blue crush is so prolonged and boring it is nt even close to being the barnburningly bad movie it promised it would be .
>2
the sequel plays out like a flimsy excuse to give blade fans another look at wesley snipes  iconic hero doing battle with dozens of bad guys  at once .
>2
so devoid of pleasure or sensuality that it can not even be dubbed hedonistic .
>1
woody allen has really found his groove these days .
>2
the problem is that it is one that allows him to churn out one mediocre movie after another .
>1
the art direction is often exquisite , and the anthropomorphic animal characters are beautifully realized through clever makeup design , leaving one to hope that the eventual dvd release will offer subtitles and the original italianlanguage soundtrack .
>2
if the predictability of bland comfort food appeals to you , then the film is a pleasant enough dish .
>2
ultimately , in the history of the academy , people may be wondering what all that jazz was about  chicago  in 2002 .
>2
zellweger s whiny poutylipped poof faced and spindly attempt at playing an ingenue makes her nomination as best actress even more of a an a
>2
a seriously bad film with seriously warped logic by writerdirector kurt wimmer at the screenplay level .
>2
a pleasant and engaging enough sit , but in trying to have the best of both worlds it ends up falling short as a whole .
>2
its plot and animation offer daytime tv serviceability , but little more .
>2
a tired , unimaginative and derivative variation of that alreadyshallow genre .
>2
human nature , in short , is nt nearly as funny as it thinks it is  neither is it as smart .
>1
a film with a great premise but only a great premise .
>2
instead of building to a laugh riot we are left with a handful of disparate funny moments of no real consequence .
>2
kirshner and monroe seem to be in a contest to see who can outbadact the other .
>2
a lame romantic comedy about an unsympathetic character and someone who would not likely be so stupid as to get involved with her .
>2
an ugly , pointless , stupid movie .
>2
simply put , there should have been a more compelling excuse to pair susan sarandon and goldie hawn .
>2
the master of disguise represents adam sandler s latest attempt to dumb down the universe .
>2
this is an ungainly movie , illfitting , with its elbows sticking out where the knees should be .
>2
too silly to take seriously .
>2
everything s serious , poetic , earnest and  sadly  dull .
>1
i like it .
>2
no , i hate it .
>1
no , i love it ... hell , i dunno .
>2
this mess of a movie is nothing short of a travesty of a transvestite comedy .
>2
it s clotted with heavyhanded symbolism , dimestore psychology and endless scenic shots that make 105 minutes seem twice as long .
>2
a fifty car pileup of cliches .
>2
it s a stale , overused cocktail using the same olives since 1962 as garnish .
>2
not only is entry number twenty the worst of the brosnan bunch , it s one of the worst of the entire franchise .
>2
what ultimately makes windtalkers a disappointment is the superficial way it deals with its story .
>1
as an actor s showcase , hart s war has much to recommend it , even if the topbilled willis is not the most impressive player .
>2
as a story of dramatic enlightenment , the screenplay by billy ray and terry george leaves something to be desired .
>2
a nonbritney person might survive a screening with little harm done , except maybe for the last 15 minutes , which are as maudlin as any afterschool special you can imagine .
>2
it s simply stupid , irrelevant and deeply , truly , bottomlessly cynical .
>2
the drama was so uninspiring that even a story immersed in love , lust , and sin could nt keep my attention .
>2
a rather tired exercise in nostalgia .
>2
the misery of these people becomes just another voyeuristic spectacle , to be consumed and forgotten .
>2
some body often looks like an episode of the tv show blind date , only less technically proficient and without the popup comments .
>2
bad company has one of the most moronic screenplays of the year , full of holes that will be obvious even to those who are nt looking for them .
>2
predecessors the mummy and the mummy returns stand as intellectual masterpieces next to the scorpion king .
>2
a markedly inactive film , city is conversational bordering on confessional .
>2
despite an impressive roster of stars and direction from kathryn bigelow , the weight of water is oppressively heavy .
>2
we ve liked klein s other work but rollerball left us cold .
>2
they were afraid to show this movie to reviewers before its opening , afraid of the bad reviews they thought they d earn .
>2
it would be churlish to begrudge anyone for receiving whatever consolation that can be found in dragonfly , yet it is impossible to find the film anything but appalling , shamelessly manipulative and contrived , and totally lacking in conviction .
>2
offers no new insight on the matter , nor do its characters exactly spring to life .
>2
nohe has made a decent  intro  documentary , but he feels like a spectator and not a participant .
>2
apparently designed as a reverie about memory and regret , but the only thing you ll regret is remembering the experience of sitting through it .
>2
a 94minute travesty of unparalleled proportions , writerdirector parker seems to go out of his way to turn the legendary wit s classic mistaken identity farce into brutally labored and unfunny hokum .
>2
guy gets girl , guy loses girl , audience falls asleep .
>2
the weird thing about the santa clause 2 , purportedly a children s movie , is that there is nothing in it to engage children emotionally .
>2
it s pretentious in a way that verges on the amateurish .
>2
contains the humor , characterization , poignancy , and intelligence of a bad sitcom .
>1
it does nt matter that the film is less than 90 minutes .
>2
it still feels like a prison stretch .
>2
partly a schmaltzy , bythenumbers romantic comedy , partly a shallow rumination on the emptiness of success  and entirely soulless .
>2
the overall feel is not unlike watching a glorified episode of  7th heaven . 
>2
just a kiss is a just a waste .
>2
... this is nt even a movie we can enjoy as mild escapism  it is one in which fear and frustration are provoked to intolerable levels .
>2
frankly , it s kind of insulting , both to men and women .
>2
and it s not that funny  which is just generally insulting .
>2
as if drop dead gorgeous was nt enough , this equally derisive clunker is fixated on the spectacle of smalltown competition .
>2
a wretched movie that reduces the second world war to one man s quest to find an old flame .
>2
this is a remake by the numbers , linking a halfwit plot to a series of standup routines in which wilson and murphy show how funny they could have been in a more ambitious movie .
>2
there s a reason why halftime is only fifteen minutes long .
>2
one of those films that started with a great premise and then just fell apart .
>2
no better or worse than  truth or consequences , n.m.  or any other interchangeable actioner with imbecilic mafia toolbags botching a routine assignment in a western backwater .
>2
i can imagine this movie as a b  w british comedy , circa 1960 , with peter sellers , kenneth williams , et al. , but at this time , with this cast , this movie is hopeless .
>2
talky , artificial and opaque ... an interesting technical exercise , but a tedious picture .
>2
and in a sense , that s a liability .
>2
it s easy to love robin tunney  she s pretty and she can act  but it gets harder and harder to understand her choices .
>2
if you ve got a house full of tots  do nt worry , this will be on video long before they grow up and you can wait till then .
>2
the new film of anton chekhov s the cherry orchard puts the  ick  in  classic . 
>2
if i want music , i ll buy the soundtrack .
>2
if i want a real movie , i ll buy the criterion dvd .
>2
writerdirector stephen gaghan has made the nearfatal mistake of being what the english call  too clever by half . 
>2
seagal ran out of movies years ago , and this is just the proof .
>2
the movie is so contrived , nonsensical and formulaic that , come to think of it , the dayold shelf would be a more appropriate location to store it .
>2
an awkwardly garish showcase that diverges from anything remotely probing or penetrating .
>2
jackass is a vulgar and cheaplooking version of candid camera staged for the marquis de sade set .
>1
children , christian or otherwise , deserve to hear the full story of jonah s despair  in all its agonizing , catch22 glory  even if they spend years trying to comprehend it .
>2
pleasant but not more than recycled jock piffle .
>2
... the kind of movie you see because the theater has air conditioning .
>2
with zoe clarkewilliams s lackluster thriller  new best friend  , who needs enemies ?
>2
just another generic drama that has nothing going for it other than its exploitive array of obligatory cheap thrills .
>2
hiphop prison thriller of stupefying absurdity .
>2
an uneven mix of dark satire and childhood awakening .
>2
the film would have been more enjoyable had the balance shifted in favor of waterbound action over the landbased  drama ,  but the emphasis on the latter leaves blue crush waterlogged .
>2
the problem is the needlessly poor quality of its archival prints and film footage .
>2
the images lack contrast , are murky and are frequently too dark to be decipherable .
>2
like a soft drink that s been sitting open too long  it s too much syrup and not enough fizz .
>2
as the movie dragged on , i thought i heard a mysterious voice , and felt myself powerfully drawn toward the light  the light of the exit sign .
>2
i have returned from the beyond to warn you  this movie is 90 minutes long , and life is too short .
>2
there are some fairly unsettling scenes , but they never succeed in really rattling the viewer .
>2
in the end , the weight of water comes to resemble the kind of softcore twaddle you d expect to see on showtime s  red shoe diaries . 
>2
a straightahead thriller that never rises above superficiality .
>2
glizty but formulaic and silly ... cagney s  top of the world  has been replaced by the bottom of the barrel .
>2
the re  enactments , however fascinating they may be as history , are too crude to serve the work especially well .
>2
is anyone else out there getting tired of the whole slomo , doublepistoled , ballisticpyrotechnic hong kong action aesthetic ?
>2
once again , director chris columbus takes a hatinhand approach to rowling that stifles creativity and allows the film to drag on for nearly three hours .
>2
serving sara is little more than a mall movie designed to kill time .
>2
the most repugnant adaptation of a classic text since roland joff and demi moore s the scarlet letter .
>2
it never plays as dramatic even when dramatic things happen to people .
>2
it labours as storytelling .
>2
the adventures of pluto nash is a whole lot of nada .
>2
a really good premise is frittered away in middleoftheroad blandness .
>2
lawrence should stick to his day job .
>1
he s a better actor than a standup comedian .
>2
despite the fact that this film was nt as bad as i thought it was going to be , it s still not a good movie
>1
a well made indieflick in need of some trims and a more chemistry between its stars .
>2
i never thought i d say this , but i d much rather watch teens poking their genitals into fruit pies !
>1
a film neither bitter nor sweet , neither romantic nor comedic , neither warm nor fuzzy .
>2
tiresomely derivative and hammily acted .
>2
we never truly come to care about the main characters and whether or not they ll wind up together , and michele s spiritual quest is neither amusing nor dramatic enough to sustain interest .
>2
the plot grows thin soon , and you find yourself praying for a quick resolution .
>2
too bad maggio could nt come up with a better script .
>2
much of the cast is stiff or just plain bad .
>2
rice is too pedestrian a filmmaker to bring any edge or personality to the rising place that would set it apart from other deep south stories .
>2
at best , cletis tout might inspire a trip to the video store  in search of a better movie experience .
>2
witless , pointless , tasteless and idiotic .
>2
not really a thriller so much as a movie for teens to laugh , groan and hiss at .
>2
as plain and pedestrian as catsup 
>1
an improvement on the feeble examples of bigscreen pokemania that have preceded it .
>2
whatever satire lucky break was aiming for , it certainly got lost in the  soontobeforgettable  section of the quirky ripoff prison romp pile .
>2
it s petty thievery like this that puts flimsy flicks like this behind bars
>2
the package in which this fascinating  and timely  content comes wrapped is disappointingly generic .
>2
guys say mean things and shoot a lot of bullets .
>2
some of the characters die and others do nt , and the film pretends that those living have learned some sort of lesson , and , really , nobody in the viewing audience cares .
>2
wildly incompetent but brilliantly named half past dead  or for seagal pessimists  totally past his prime .
>2
just another combination of bad animation and mindless violence ... lacking the slightest bit of wit or charm .
>2
all the movie s narrative gymnastics ca nt disguise the fact that it s inauthentic at its core and that its story just is nt worth telling .
>2
much like its easily dismissive take on the upscale lifestyle , there is nt much there here .
>2
the film ultimately offers nothing more than people in an urban jungle needing other people to survive ...
>2
for all its shootouts , fistfights , and car chases , this movie is a phlegmatic bore , so tedious it makes the silly spy vs. spy film the sum of all fears , starring ben affleck , seem downright hitchcockian .
>2
this mildmannered farce , directed by one of its writers , john c. walsh , is corny in a way that bespeaks an expiration date passed a long time ago .
>2
a bit too eager to please .
>2
kapur s contradictory feelings about his material result in a movie that works against itself .
>1
 the road paved with good intentions leads to the video store 
>2
animated drivel meant to enhance the selfimage of drooling idiots .
>2
one scene after another in this supposedly funny movie falls to the floor with a sickening thud .
>2
 the chteau is never quite able to overcome the cultural moat surrounding its ludicrous and contrived plot . 
>2
jacobi , the most fluent of actors , is given relatively dry material from nijinsky s writings to perform , and the visuals , even erotically frank ones , become dullingly repetitive .
>1
crudup s screen presence is the one thing that holds interest in the midst of a mushy , existential exploration of why men leave their families .
>2
despite terrific special effects and funnier gags , harry potter and the chamber of secrets finds a way to make j.k. rowling s marvelous series into a deadly bore .
>2
an incredibly narrow injoke targeted to the tiniest segment of an already obscure demographic .
>2
the only thing i laughed at were the people who paid to see it .
>2
all of the elements are in place for a great film noir , but director george hickenlooper s approach to the material is too upbeat .
>2
the hackneyed story about an affluent damsel in distress who decides to fight her bully of a husband is simply too overdone .
>2
then you get another phone call warning you that if the video is nt back at blockbuster before midnight , you re going to face frightening late fees .
>2
possibly the most irresponsible picture ever released by a major film studio .
>2
... a cheap , ludicrous attempt at serious horror .
>2
those of you who are not an eighth grade girl will most likely doze off during this one .
>2
befuddled in its characterizations as it begins to seem as long as the two year affair which is its subject
>2
the movie would seem less of a trifle if ms. sugarman followed through on her defiance of the saccharine .
>2
it s just not very smart .
>2
like the excruciating end of days , collateral damage presents schwarzenegger as a tragic figure , but sympathy really belongs with any viewer forced to watch him try out so many complicated facial expressions .
>2
in trying to be daring and original , it comes off as only occasionally satirical and never fresh .
>2
90 punitive minutes of eardrumdicing gunplay , screechingmetal smashups , and flaccid oddcouple sniping .
>2
sadly , though many of the actors throw off a spark or two when they first appear , they ca nt generate enough heat in this cold vacuum of a comedy to start a reaction .
>2
never capitalizes on this concept and opts for the breezy and amateurish feel of an after school special on the subject of tolerance .
>2
after a while , hoffman s quirks and mannerisms , particularly his penchant for tearing up on cue  things that seem so real in small doses  become annoying and artificial .
>2
this wretchedly unfunny wannabe comedy is inane and awful  no doubt , it s the worst movie i ve seen this summer .
>2
it s drab .
>2
it s uninteresting .
>2
it squanders chan s uniqueness  it could even be said to squander jennifer love hewitt !
>2
the movie keeps coming back to the achingly unfunny phonce and his several silly subplots .
>2
this tale has been told and retold  the races and rackets change , but the song remains the same .
>2
a surprisingly flat retread , hobbled by halfbaked setups and sluggish pacing .
>2
forget the psychology 101 study of romantic obsession and just watch the procession of costumes in castles and this wo nt seem like such a bore .
>2
a film that should be relegated to a dark video store corner is somehow making its way instead to theaters .
>2
it s hard to imagine acting that could be any flatter .
>2
new ways of describing badness need to be invented to describe exactly how bad it is .
>2
lots of effort and intelligence are on display but in execution it is all awkward , static , and lifeless rumblings .
>1
when cowering and begging at the feet a scruffy giannini , madonna gives her best performance since abel ferrara had her beaten to a pulp in his dangerous game .
>2
i suspect that there are more interesting ways of dealing with the subject .
>2
the film itself is about something very interesting and odd that would probably work better as a real documentary without the insinuation of mediocre acting or a fairly trite narrative .
>2
their parents would do well to cram earplugs in their ears and put pillowcases over their heads for 87 minutes .
>2
for all its violence , the movie is remarkably dull with only caine making much of an impression .
>2
a subformulaic slap in the face to seasonal cheer .
>2
several uninteresting , unlikeable people do bad things to and with each other in  unfaithful . 
>2
why anyone who is not a character in this movie should care is beyond me .
>2
hill looks to be going through the motions , beginning with the pale script .
>1
howard conjures the past via surrealist flourishes so overwrought you d swear he just stepped out of a buuel retrospective .
>2
it s not a bad premise , just a bad movie .
>2
an already thin story boils down to surviving invaders seeking an existent antivirus .
>2
by the time the surprise ending is revealed , interest can not be revived .
>2
a peculiar misfire that even tunney ca nt save .
>2
watching queen of the damned is like reading a research paper , with special effects tossed in .
>2
i ca nt remember the last time i saw worse stunt editing or cheaper action movie production values than in extreme ops .
>2
too much of nemesis has a tired , talky feel .
>2
i felt trapped and with no obvious escape for the entire 100 minutes .
>2
leaves us wondering less about its ideas and more about its characterization of hitler and the contrived nature of its provocative conclusion .
>2
it is that rare combination of bad writing , bad direction and bad acting  the trifecta of badness .
>2
a soulless jumble of ineptly assembled cliches and pabulum that plays like a 95minute commercial for nba properties .
>2
borstal boy represents the worst kind of filmmaking , the kind that pretends to be passionate and truthful but is really frustratingly timid and soggy .
>2
the film s lack of personality permeates all its aspects  from the tv movieesque , affected child acting to the dullest irish pub scenes ever filmed .
>2
works on the whodunit level as its larger themes get lost in the murk of its own making
>2
crush could be the worst film a man has made about women since valley of the dolls .
>1
4ever has the same sledgehammer appeal as pokemon videos , but it breathes more on the big screen and induces headaches more slowly .
>2
feels like the work of someone who may indeed have finally aged past his prime ... and , perhaps more than he realizes , just wants to be liked by the people who can still give him work .
>2
viewers of barney s crushingly selfindulgent spectacle will see nothing in it to match the ordeal of sitting through it .
>2
sayles ... once again strands his superb performers in the same old story .
>2
the piano teacher , like its title character , is repellantly out of control .
>2
i have to admit i walked out of runteldat .
>2
i did go back and check out the last 10 minutes , but these were more repulsive than the first 30 or 40 minutes .
>2
there s already been too many of these films ...
>1
several of steven soderbergh s earlier films were hailed as the works of an artist .
>2
sadly , full frontal plays like the work of a dilettante .
>2
clockstoppers is one of those crazy , mixedup films that does nt know what it wants to be when it grows up .
>2
 the war of the roses ,  trailertrash style .
>2
supposedly , pokemon ca nt be killed , but pokemon 4ever practically assures that the pocket monster movie franchise is nearly ready to keel over .
>2
white has nt developed characters so much as caricatures , onedimensional buffoons that get him a few laughs but nothing else .
>2
the film feels formulaic , its plot and pacing typical hollywood warmovie stuff , while the performances elicit more of a sense of deja vu than awe .
>2
this overproduced piece of dreck is shockingly bad and absolutely unnecessary .
>2
hmmm ... might i suggest that the wayward wooden one end it all by stuffing himself into an electric pencil sharpener ?
>2
the makers of mothman prophecies succeed in producing that most frightening of all movies  a mediocre horror film too bad to be good and too good to be bad .
>2
mr. deeds is not really a film as much as it is a loose collection of notsofunny gags , scattered moments of lazy humor .
>2
how this one escaped the lifetime network i ll never know .
>2
could nt someone take rob schneider and have him switch bodies with a funny person ?
>2
one of these days hollywood will come up with an original idea for a teen movie , but until then there s always these rehashes to feed to the younger generations .
>2
for all its brilliant touches , dragon loses its fire midway , nearly flickering out by its perfunctory conclusion .
>2
i have to admit that i am baffled by jason x.
>2
a meanspirited film made by someone who surely read the catcher in the rye but clearly suffers from dyslexia
>2
instead of a witty expose on the banality and hypocrisy of too much kidvid , we get an ugly , meanspirited lashing out by an adult who s apparently been forced by his kids to watch too many barney videos .
>2
this is a film living far too much in its own head .
>2
dogtown is hollow , selfindulgent , and  worst of all  boring .
>2
a movie so bad that it quickly enters the pantheon of wreckage that includes battlefield earth and showgirls .
>2
it s just too bad the screenwriters eventually shoot themselves in the feet with cop flick cliches like an oily arms dealer , squad car pileups and the requisite screaming captain .
>2
to be influenced chiefly by humanity s greatest shame , reality shows  reality shows for god s sake !
>2
 is a crime that should be punishable by chainsaw .
>2
a frustrating  tweener   too slick , contrived and exploitative for the art houses and too cynical , small and decadent for the malls .
>1
what s surprising about this traditional thriller , moderately successful but not completely satisfying , is exactly how genteel and unsurprising the execution turns out to be .
>2
drowning s too good for this sucker .
>2
an instantly forgettable snowandstuntwork extravaganza that likely will be upstaged by an avalanche of more appealing holidayseason product .
>2
frankly , it s pretty stupid .
>2
but there s plenty to offend everyone ...
>2
love liza is a festival film that would have been better off staying on the festival circuit .
>2
quite frankly , i ca nt see why any actor of talent would ever work in a mcculloch production again if they looked at how this movie turned out .
>2
my precious new star wars movie is a lumbering , wheezy drag ...
>2
too campy to work as straight drama and too violent and sordid to function as comedy , vulgar is , truly and thankfully , a oneofakind work .
>1
horrid little propaganda film with fascinating connections not only to the serbs themselves but also to a network of american rightwing extremists .
>2
should have gone straight to video .
>2
it looks like an action movie , but it s so poorly made , on all levels , that it does nt even qualify as a spoof of such .
>2
it is supremely unfunny and unentertaining to watch middleage and older men drink to excess , piss on trees , b.s. one another and put on a show in drag .
>2
consider the film a celluloid litmus test for the intellectual and emotional pedigree of your date and a giant step backward for a director i admire .
>2
a boring , pretentious muddle that uses a sensational , reallife 19thcentury crime as a metaphor for  well , i m not exactly sure what  and has all the dramatic weight of a raindrop .
>2
sheridan had a wonderful account to work from , but , curiously , he waters it down , turning grit and vulnerability into light reading .
>2
heavy with flabby rolls of typical toback machinations .
>2
it is very difficult to care about the character , and that is the central flaw of the film .
>2
snow dogs finds its humour in a black man getting humiliated by a pack of dogs who are smarter than him
>2
whole stretches of the film may be incomprehensible to moviegoers not already clad in basic black .
>2
reggio and glass so rhapsodize cynicism , with repetition and languorous slomo sequences , that glass s dirgelike score becomes a fangbaring lullaby .
>2
ends up offering nothing more than the latest schwarzenegger or stallone flick would .
>2
if the tuxedo actually were a suit , it would fit chan like a  99 bargainbasement special .
>2
parents beware  this is downright movie penance .
>2
... a complete shambles of a movie so sloppy , so uneven , so damn unpleasant that i ca nt believe any viewer , young or old , would have a good time here .
>2
has nothing good to speak about other than the fact that it is relatively short , tries its best to hide the fact that seagal s overweight and out of shape .
>2
a pathetically inane and unimaginative cross between xxx and vertical limit .
>2
feels at times like a giant commercial for universal studios , where much of the action takes place .
>2
britney spears  phoniness is nothing compared to the movie s contrived , lame screenplay and listless direction .
>2
every sequel you skip will be two hours gained .
>2
but it has an ambition to say something about its subjects , but not a willingness .
>2
twentythree movies into a mostly magnificent directorial career , clint eastwood s efficiently minimalist style finally has failed him .
>2
it should have stayed there .
>2
but the feelings evoked in the film are lukewarm and quick to pass .
>2
the most opaque , selfindulgent and just plain goofy an excuse for a movie as you can imagine .
>2
big fat liar is little more than home alone raised to a new , selfdeprecating level .
>2
loses its sense of humor in a vat of failed jokes , twitchy acting , and general boorishness .
>2
there s a delightfully quirky movie to be made from curling , but brooms is nt it .
>2
the story suffers a severe case of oversimplification , superficiality and silliness .
>1
chamber of secrets will find millions of eager fans .
>2
but if the essence of magic is its makebelieve promise of life that soars above the material realm , this is the opposite of a truly magical movie .
>1
too clever by about ninetenths .
>2
has all the hallmarks of a movie designed strictly for children s home video , a market so insatiable it absorbs all manner of lame entertainment , as long as 3yearolds find it diverting .
>2
bears about as much resemblance to the experiences of most battered women as spiderman does to the experiences of most teenagers .
>2
toward the end sum of all fears morphs into a mundane 70s disaster flick .
>1
director carl franklin , so crisp and economical in one false move , bogs down in genre cliches here .
>2
mendes still does nt quite know how to fill a frame .
>2
like the hanks character , he s a slow study  the action is stilted and the tabloid energy embalmed .
>2
this thing is just garbage .
>2
there must be an audience that enjoys the friday series , but i would nt be interested in knowing any of them personally .
>2
an empty exercise , a florid but ultimately vapid crime melodrama with lots of surface flash but little emotional resonance .
>2
my own minority report is that it stinks .
>2
trying to make head or tail of the story in the hiphop indie snipes is enough to give you brain strain  and the payoff is negligible .
>1
the script is high on squaddie banter , low on shocks .
>2
... if you , like me , think an action film disguised as a war tribute is disgusting to begin with , then you re in for a painful ride .
>2
while solondz tries and tries hard , storytelling fails to provide much more insight than the inside column of a torn book jacket .
>2
with very little to add beyond the dark visions already relayed by superb recent predecessors like swimming with sharks and the player , this latest skewering ... may put off insiders and outsiders alike .
>2
without a fresh infusion of creativity , 4ever is neither a promise nor a threat so much as wishful thinking .
>2
being unique does nt necessarily equate to being good , no matter how admirably the filmmakers have gone for broke .
>2
a few hours after you ve seen it , you forget you ve been to the movies .
>1
waydowntown may not be an important movie , or even a good one , but it provides a nice change of mindless pace in collision with the hot oscar season currently underway .
>2
yes , i suppose it s lovely that cal works out his issues with his dad and comes to terms with his pictureperfect life  but world traveler gave me no reason to care , so i did nt .
>2
it is not the first time that director sara sugarman stoops to having characters drop their pants for laughs and not the last time she fails to provoke them .
>2
i d be hard pressed to think of a film more cloyingly sappy than evelyn this year .
>2
nothing more than an amiable but unfocused bagatelle that plays like a looselyconnected string of actingworkshop exercises .
>2
what remains is a variant of the nincompoop benigni persona , here a more annoying , though less angry version of the irresponsible sandlerian manchild , undercut by the voice of the star of road trip .
>2
a backhanded ode to female camaraderie penned by a man who has little clue about either the nature of women or of friendship .
>2
take away the controversy , and it s not much more watchable than a mexican soap opera .
>2
it s got the brawn , but not the brains .
>2
mindless and boring martial arts and gunplay with too little excitement and zero compelling storyline .
>2
a lot of talent is wasted in this crass , lowwattage endeavor .
>2
about one in three gags in white s intermittently wise script hits its mark  the rest are padding unashamedly appropriated from the teenexploitation playbook .
>2
little is done to support the premise other than fling gags at it to see which ones shtick .
>2
one of those films that seems tailor made to air on pay cable to offer some modest amusements when one has nothing else to watch .
>1
the big ending surprise almost saves the movie .
>2
it s probably not easy to make such a worthless film ...
>2
has no reason to exist , other than to employ hollywood kids and people who owe favors to their famous parents .
>2
constantly slips from the grasp of its maker .
>2
in the era of the sopranos , it feels painfully redundant and inauthentic .
>2
the overall vibe is druggy and selfindulgent , like a springbreak orgy for pretentious arts majors .
>2
breen s script is sketchy with actorish notations on the margin of acting .
>2
if only merchant paid more attention the story .
>2
at the onehour mark , herzog simply runs out of ideas and the pace turns positively leaden as the movie sputters to its inevitable tragic conclusion .
>2
... too contrived to be as naturally charming as it needs to be .
>2
a simpler , leaner treatment would have been preferable  after all , being about nothing is sometimes funnier than being about something .
>2
the characters are based on stock clichs , and the attempt to complicate the story only defies credibility .
>2
everything about it from the bland songs to the colorful but flat drawings is completely serviceable and quickly forgettable .
>1
not the great american comedy , but if you liked the previous movies in the series , you ll have a good time with this one too .
>2
a domestic melodrama with weak dialogue and biopic cliches .
>2
mr. goyer s loose , unaccountable direction is technically sophisticated in the worst way .
>1
the movie is so thoughtlessly assembled .
>2
plays like some corny television production from a bygone era
>2
the end result is like cold porridge with only the odd enjoyably chewy lump .
>1
for all the charm of kevin kline and a story that puts oldfashioned values under the microscope , there s something creepy about this movie .
>2
i was feeling this movie until it veered off too far into the exxon zone , and left me behind at the station looking for a return ticket to realism .
>1
producer john penotti surveyed high school students ... and came back with the astonishing revelation that  they wanted to see something that did nt talk down to them . 
>2
ignoring that , he made swimfan anyway
>2
naipaul fans may be disappointed .
>2
those who are not acquainted with the author s work , on the other hand , may fall fast asleep .
>2
hoffman waits too long to turn his movie in an unexpected direction , and even then his tone retains a genteel , prepschool quality that feels dusty and leatherbound .
>2
if you re looking for a story , do nt bother .
>2
full frontal had no effect and elicited no sympathies for any of the characters .
>2
by that measure , it is a failure .
>2
a baffling mixed platter of gritty realism and magic realism with a hardtoswallow premise .
>2
an affable but undernourished romantic comedy that fails to match the freshness of the actressproducer and writer s previous collaboration , miss congeniality .
>2
like a pack of dynamite sticks , built for controversy .
>2
has its charming quirks and its dull spots .
>2
an admitted egomaniac , evans is no hollywood villain , and yet this grating showcase almost makes you wish he d gone the way of don simpson .
>2
the audience when i saw this one was chuckling at all the wrong times , and that s a bad sign when they re supposed to be having a collective heart attack .
>2
everyone s to blame here .
>2
you get the impression that writer and director burr steers knows the territory ... but his sense of humor has yet to lose the smug selfsatisfaction usually associated with the better private schools .
>2
less a study in madness or love than a study in schoolgirl obsession .
>2
rice never clearly defines his characters or gives us a reason to care about them .
>2
but what is missing from it all is a moral .
>2
why did they deem it necessary to document all this emotional misery ?
>2
you see the movie and you think , zzzzzzzzz .
>2
downright transparent is the script s endless assault of embarrassingly hamfisted sex jokes that reek of a script rewrite designed to garner the film a  cooler  pg13 rating .
>2
the movie slides downhill as soon as macho action conventions assert themselves .
>2
formulaic to the 51st power , more like .
>2
howard and his costars all give committed performances , but they re often undone by howard s selfconscious attempts to find a  literary  filmmaking style to match his subject .
>2
comes off more like a misdemeanor , a flat , unconvincing drama that never catches fire .
>2
offers absolutely nothing i had nt already seen .
>2
 analyze that  is one of those crass , contrived sequels that not only fails on its own , but makes you secondguess your affection for the original .
>2
suffice to say its total promise is left slightly unfulfilled .
>2
complex , sinuously plotted and , somehow , offputtingly cold .
>1
firsttime writerdirector dylan kidd also has a good ear for dialogue , and the characters sound like real people .
>2
... an airless , prepackaged julia roberts wannabe that stinks so badly of hardsell imagemongering you ll wonder if lopez s publicist should share screenwriting credit .
>2
goldmember has none of the visual wit of the previous pictures , and it looks as though jay roach directed the film from the back of a taxicab .
>2
could as easily have been called  under siege 3  in alcatraz  ... a cinematic corpse that never springs to life .
>2
in comparison to his earlier films it seems a disappointingly thin slice of lowerclass london life  despite the title ... amounts to surprisingly little .
>2
lame sweet home leaves no southern stereotype unturned .
>2
the jokes are sophomoric , stereotypes are sprinkled everywhere and the acting ranges from bad to bodacious .
>1
will give many ministers and biblestudy groups hours of material to discuss .
>2
but mainstream audiences will find little of interest in this film , which is often preachy and poorly acted .
>2
in its chicken heart , crush goes to absurd lengths to duck the very issues it raises .
>2
this long and relentlessly saccharine film is a clear case of preaching to the converted .
>2
the film is flat .
>2
the movie is a lumbering load of hokum but ... it s at least watchable .
>2
it s a boombox of a movie that might have been titled  the loud and the ludicrous  ... the pandering to a moviegoing audience dominated by young males is all too calculated .
>2
an unbelievably stupid film , though occasionally fun enough to make you forget its absurdity .
>2
the first fatal attraction was vile enough .
>2
do we really need the tiger beat version ?
>2
this bond film goes off the beaten path , not necessarily for the better .
>2
the problem is that the movie has no idea of it is serious or not .
>2
when the fire burns out , we ve only come facetoface with a couple dragons and that s where the film ultimately fails .
>2
the elements were all there but lack of a pyschological center knocks it flat .
>2
an unsuccessful attempt at a movie of ideas .
>2
queen of the damned as you might have guessed , makes sorry use of aaliyah in her one and only starring role  she does little here but point at things that explode into flame .
>2
this toothless dog , already on cable , loses all bite on the big screen .
>2
it made me feel unclean , and i m the guy who liked there s something about mary and both american pie movies .
>2
not only is it hokey , manipulative and as bland as wonder bread dipped in milk , but it also does the absolute last thing we need hollywood doing to us  it preaches .
>2
it s so crammed with scenes and vistas and pretty moments that it s left a few crucial things out , like character development and coherence .
>2
serving sara should be served an eviction notice at every theater stuck with it .
>2
a loud , lowbudget and tired formula film that arrives cloaked in the euphemism  urban drama . 
>2
a pathetic exploitation film that tries to seem sincere , and just seems worse for the effort .
>2
at some point , all this visual trickery stops being clever and devolves into flashy , vaguely silly overkill .
>2
despite some charm and heart , this quirky soccer import is forgettable
>2
meyjes s movie , like max rothman s future , does not work .
>2
what s needed so badly but what is virtually absent here is either a saving dark humor or the feel of poetic tragedy .
>2
schneidermeister ... makin  a fool of himself ... losin  his fan base ...
>2
not once does it come close to being exciting .
>1
it plays like a bigbudget , afterschool special with a generous cast , who at times lift the material from its wellmeaning clunkiness .
>2
one of those strained caper movies that s hardly any fun to watch and begins to vaporize from your memory minutes after it ends .
>2
needed a little less blingbling and a lot more romance .
>2
it s hard to believe these jokers are supposed to have pulled off four similar kidnappings before .
>2
i m not exactly sure what this movie thinks it is about .
>2
cal is an unpleasantly shallow and immature character with whom to spend 110 claustrophobic minutes .
>2
the bottom line , at least in my opinion , is imposter makes a better short story than it does a film .
>2
it is just too bad the film s story does not live up to its style .
>2
unless you re a fanatic , the best advice is   scooby  do nt .
>2
a cautionary tale about the folly of superficiality that is itself endlessly superficial .
>2
if you re looking to rekindle the magic of the first film , you ll need a stronger stomach than us .
>2
shreve s graceful dual narrative gets clunky on the screen , and we keep getting torn away from the compelling historical tale to a lesscompelling soap opera .
>2
contains a few big laughs but many more that graze the funny bone or miss it altogether , in part because the consciously dumbeddown approach wears thin .
>2
nothing more than a widget cranked out on an assembly line to see if stupid americans will get a kick out of goofy brits with cute accents performing agesold slapstick and unfunny tricks .
>2
this is a film tailormade for those who when they were in high school would choose the cliffnotes over reading a fulllength classic .
>2
a jumbled fantasy comedy that did not figure out a coherent game plan at scripting , shooting or postproduction stages .
>2
a sad and rote exercise in milking a playedout idea  a straight guy has to dress up in drag  that shockingly manages to be even worse than its title would imply .
>2
two big things are missing  anything approaching a visceral kick , and anything approaching even a vague reason to sit through it all .
>2
scarcely worth a mention apart from reporting on the number of tumbleweeds blowing through the empty theatres graced with its company .
>2
and as with most latenight bull sessions , eventually the content is nt nearly as captivating as the rowdy participants think it is .
>2
too stagey , talky  and long  for its own good .
>2
apparently reassembled from the cuttingroom floor of any given daytime soap .
>2
the sinister inspiration that fuelled devito s early work is confused in death to smoochy into something both ugly and mindless .
>2
despite auteuil s performance , it s a rather listless amble down the middle of the road , where the thematic ironies are too obvious and the sexual politics too smug .
>2
never comes together as a coherent whole .
>2
an unintentionally surreal kid s picture ... in which actors in bad bear suits enact a sort of interspecies parody of a vh1 behind the music episode .
>2
first , for a movie that tries to be smart , it s kinda dumb .
>2
and second , what s with all the shooting ?
>2
do nt even bother to rent this on video .
>2
there is something in full frontal , i guess , about artifice and acting and how it distorts reality for people who make movies and watch them , but like most movie riddles , it works only if you have an interest in the characters you see .
>2
this is the kind of movie that gets a quick release before real contenders arrive in september .
>2
not counting a few grossout comedies i ve been trying to forget , this is the first film in a long time that made me want to bolt the theater in the first 10 minutes .
>2
plays like one long , meandering sketch inspired by the works of john waters and todd solondz , rather than a fully developed story .
>2
the film does nt have enough innovation or pizazz to attract teenagers , and it lacks the novel charm that made spy kids a surprising winner with both adults and younger audiences .
>2
a mawkish selfparody that plays like some weird masterpiece theater sketch with neither a point of view nor a compelling reason for being .
>2
an average bmovie with no aspirations to be anything more .
>2
the plot is plastered with one hollywood cliche after another , most of which involve precocious kids getting the better of obnoxious adults .
>2
a film that suffers because of its many excesses .
>2
too bland and fustily tasteful to be truly prurient .
>2
in any case , i would recommend big bad love only to winger fans who have missed her since 1995 s forget paris .
>2
but even then , i d recommend waiting for dvd and just skipping straight to her scenes .
>2
depicts the sorriest and most sordid of human behavior on the screen , then laughs at how clever it s being .
>2
nijinsky says ,  i know how to suffer  and if you see this film you ll know too .
>2
 cq may one day be fondly remembered as roman coppola s brief pretentious period before going on to other films that actually tell a story worth caring about
>2
the only thing scary about feardotcom is that the filmmakers and studio are brazen enough to attempt to pass this stinker off as a scary movie .
>2
... the story simply putters along looking for astute observations and coming up blank .
>2
instead of contriving a climactic hero s death for the belovedmajor  characterwhoshall  remainnameless , why not invite some genuine spontaneity into the film by having the evil aliens  laser guns actually hit something for once ?
>2
this actionthrillerdark comedy is one of the most repellent things to pop up in a cinematic year already littered with celluloid garbage .
>2
mib ii is a movie that makes it possible for the viewer to doze off for a few minutes or make several runs to the concession stand andor restroom and not feel as if he or she has missed anything .
>2
that s because relatively nothing happens .
>2
no amount of arty theorizing  the special effects are  germanexpressionist ,  according to the press notes  can render it anything but laughable .
>2
blue crush follows the formula , but throws in too many conflicts to keep the story compelling .
>2
there s not a spark of new inspiration in it , just more of the same , done with noticeably less energy and imagination .
>2
jackson shamefully strolls through this mess with a smug grin , inexplicably wearing a kilt and carrying a bag of golf clubs over one shoulder .
>2
a moving picture that does not move .
>2
romething s really wrong with this ricture !
>2
its salient points are simultaneously buried , drowned and smothered in the excesses of writerdirector roger avary .
>2
i m not sure these words have ever been together in the same sentence  this erotic cannibal movie is boring .
>2
 god help us , but capra and cooper are rolling over in their graves . 
>2
... an hourandahalf of inoffensive , unmemorable filler .
>2
is it a comedy ?
>2
a cartoon ?
>2
and that is where ararat went astray .
>2
it s a bad sign in a thriller when you instantly know whodunit .
>2
has a customarily jovial air but a deficit of flimflam inventiveness .
>2
eight legged freaks wo nt join the pantheon of great monsterscience fiction flicks that we have come to love ...
>2
it gets the details of its time frame right but it completely misses its emotions .
>2
who , exactly , is fighting whom here ?
>2
ah , yes , that would be me  fighting off the urge to doze .
>2
a kilted jackson is an unsettling sight , and indicative of his , if you will , outofkilter character , who rambles aimlessly through illconceived action pieces .
>2
contrived , awkward and filled with unintended laughs , the film shows signs that someone other than the director got into the editing room and tried to improve things by making the movie go faster .
>2
starts out with tremendous promise , introducing an intriguing and alluring premise , only to fall prey to a boatload of screenwriting cliches that sink it faster than a leaky freighter .
>2
the film lapses too often into sugary sentiment and withholds delivery on the pellmell pyrotechnics its punchy style promises .
>2
the only question ... is to determine how well the schmaltz is manufactured  to assess the quality of the manipulative engineering .
>2
average , at best , i m afraid .
>2
this movie is so bad , that it s almost worth seeing because it s so bad .
>2
this movie feel more like a nonstop cry for attention , than an attempt at any kind of satisfying entertainment .
>2
love may have been in the air onscreen , but i certainly was nt feeling any of it .
>2
in addition to the overcooked , hamfisted direction , which has all the actors reaching for the back row , the dialogue sounds like horrible poetry .
>2
the very definition of what critics have come to term an  ambitious failure . 
>2
it s as if de palma spent an hour setting a fancy table and then served up kraft macaroni and cheese .
>2
the movie ends with outtakes in which most of the characters forget their lines and just utter  uhhh ,  which is better than most of the writing in the movie .
>2
worthy of the gong .
>2
while certainly more naturalistic than its australian counterpart , amari s film falls short in building the drama of lilia s journey .
>2
i found the movie as divided against itself as the dysfunctional family it portrays .
>2
the soulsearching deliberateness of the film , although leavened nicely with dry absurdist wit , eventually becomes too heavy for the plot .
>2
the movie does nt add anything fresh to the myth .
>2
as inept as bigscreen remakes of the avengers and the wild wild west .
>2
comes across as a relic from a bygone era , and its convolutions ... feel silly rather than plausible .
>2
moves in such odd plot directions and descends into such messagemongering moralism that its good qualities are obscured .
>1
it s a very sincere work , but it would be better as a diary or documentary .
>2
once one experiences mr. haneke s own sadistic tendencies toward his audience , one is left with a sour taste in one s mouth , and little else .
>2
that chirpy songbird britney spears has popped up with more mindless drivel .
>2
it s a loathsome movie , it really is and it makes absolutely no sense .
>2
a chiller resolutely without chills .
>2
for those of us who respond more strongly to storytelling than computergenerated effects , the new star wars installment has nt escaped the rut dug by the last one .
>2
the director mostly plays it straight , turning leys  fable into a listless climb down the social ladder .
>2
 bad  is the operative word for  bad company ,  and i do nt mean that in a good way .
>2
though frida is easier to swallow than julie taymor s preposterous titus , the eye candy here lacks considerable brio .
>1
drumline is  the mere suggestion , albeit a visually compelling one , of a fully realized story .
>2
the whole movie is simply a lazy exercise in bad filmmaking that asks you to not only suspend your disbelief but your intelligence as well .
>2
billy crystal and robert de niro sleepwalk through vulgarities in a sequel you can refuse .
>2
it s loud and boring  watching it is like being trapped at a bad rock concert .
>2
if you want a movie time trip , the 1960 version is a far smoother ride .
>2
the story is  forgive me  a little thin , and the filmmaking clumsy and rushed .
>2
... grows decidedly flimsier with its many outsized , out of character and logically porous action set pieces .
>2
this would have been better than the fiction it has concocted , and there still could have been room for the war scenes .
>2
aggressive selfglorification and a manipulative whitewash .
>1
stay for the credits and see a devastating comic impersonation by dustin hoffman that is revelatory .
>2
none of the characters or plotlines are fleshedout enough to build any interest .
>2
the whole film has this sneaky feel to it  as if the director is trying to dupe the viewer into taking it all as very important simply because the movie is ugly to look at and not a hollywood product .
>2
the only way to tolerate this insipid , brutally clueless film might be with a large dose of painkillers .
>1
coppola has made a film of intoxicating atmosphere and little else .
>2
bad and baffling from the getgo .
>2
a series of immaculately composed shots of patch adams quietly freaking out does not make for much of a movie .
>2
at a time when we ve learned the hard way just how complex international terrorism is , collateral damage paints an absurdly simplistic picture .
>2
like a can of 2day old coke .
>2
you can taste it , but there s no fizz .
>2
there s no excuse for following up a delightful , wellcrafted family film with a computergenerated cold fish .
>2
but they do nt fit well together and neither is well told .
>2
it s both sitcomishly predictable and cloying in its attempts to be poignant .
>2
other than a mildly engaging central romance , hospital is sickly entertainment at best and minddestroying cinematic pollution at worst .
>2
jaglom offers the nonetoooriginal premise that everyone involved with moviemaking is a con artist and a liar .
>2
outside of burger s desire to make some kind of film , it s really unclear why this project was undertaken
>2
let s see , a haunted house , a haunted ship , what s next ... ghost blimp ?
>2
a fragile framework upon which to hang broad , mildly fleshedout characters that seem to have been conjured up only 10 minutes prior to filming .
>2
by the time the plot grinds itself out in increasingly incoherent fashion , you might be wishing for a watch that makes time go faster rather than the other way around .
>2
wes craven s presence is felt  not the craven of  a nightmare on elm street  or  the hills have eyes ,  but the sad schlock merchant of  deadly friend . 
>2
but the cinematography is cloudy , the picture making becalmed .
>2
it s one long bore .
>2
it gets old quickly .
>2
watch barbershop again if you re in need of a cube fix  this is nt worth sitting through .
>2
it s leaden and predictable , and laughs are lacking .
>2
... a cinematic disaster so inadvertently sidesplitting it s worth the price of admission for the ridicule factor alone .
>2
skip this dreck , rent animal house and go back to the source .
>2
the movie is a desperate miscalculation .
>2
it gives poor dana carvey nothing to do that is really funny , and then expects us to laugh because he acts so goofy all the time .
>2
we just do nt really care too much about this love story .
>2
in that setting , their struggle is simply too ludicrous and borderline insulting .
>2
the transporter bombards the viewer with so many explosions and side snap kicks that it ends up being surprisingly dull .
>2
uzumaki s interesting social parallel and defiant aesthetic seems a prostituted muse ...
>1
large budget notwithstanding , the movie is such a blip on the year s radar screen that it s tempting just to go with it for the ride .
>2
but this time , the old mib label stands for milder is nt better .
>2
feels familiar and tired .
>2
a retread of material already thoroughly plumbed by martin scorsese .
>2
instead of making his own style , director marcus adams just copies from various sources  good sources , bad mixture
>1
criminal conspiracies and true romances move so easily across racial and cultural lines in the film that it makes my big fat greek wedding look like an apartheid drama .
>2
a bore that tends to hammer home every one of its points .
>2
a story which fails to rise above its disgusting source material .
>2
it s fitting that a movie as artificial and soulless as the country bears owes its genesis to an animatronic display at disneyland .
>2
starts as an intense political and psychological thriller but is sabotaged by ticking time bombs and other hollywoodaction cliches .
>2
completely creatively stillborn and executed in a manner that i m not sure could be a single iota worse ... a soulless hunk of exploitative garbage .
>2
an uneven look into a grim future that does nt come close to the level of intelligence and visual splendour that can be seen in other films based on philip k. dick stories .
>2
horrible .
>2
the disjointed mess flows as naturally as jolie s hideous yellow  do .
>2
an authentically vague , but ultimately purposeless , study in total pandemonium .
>2
makes a joke out of car chases for an hour and then gives us half an hour of car chases .
>2
the only thing to fear about  fear dot com  is hitting your head on the theater seat in front of you when you doze off thirty minutes into the film .
>2
it s too interested in jerking off in all its byzantine incarnations to bother pleasuring its audience .
>2
 synthetic  is the best description of this wellmeaning , beautifully produced film that sacrifices its promise for a highpowered star pedigree .
>2
it concentrates far too much on the awkward interplay and utter lack of chemistry between chan and hewitt .
>2
impostor ca nt think of a thing to do with these characters except have them run through dark tunnels , fight off various anonymous attackers , and evade elaborate surveillance technologies .
>2
judd s characters ought to pick up the durable best seller smart women , foolish choices for advice .
>2
the script has less spice than a rat burger and the rock s fighting skills are more in line with steven seagal .
>2
this illconceived and expensive project winds up looking like a bunch of talented thesps slumming it .
>2
... there s a choppy , surfaceeffect feeling to the whole enterprise .
>2
does nt get the job done , running off the limited chemistry created by ralph fiennes and jennifer lopez .
>2
a particularly joyless , and exceedingly dull , period comingofage tale .
>2
... it was nt the subject matter that ultimately defeated the film ... it was the unfulfilling , incongruous ,  wait a second , did i miss something ? 
>2
this is a movie where the most notable observation is how long you ve been sitting still .
>2
poor editing , bad bluescreen , and ultracheesy dialogue highlight the radical action .
>2
it s super  violent , superserious and superstupid .
>2
just a string of stale gags , with no good inside dope , and no particular bite .
>2
it s splash without the jokes .
>2
the chteau would have been benefited from a sharper , cleaner script before it went in front of the camera .
>2
shallow , noisy and pretentious .
>2
morrissette has performed a difficult task indeed  he s taken one of the world s most fascinating stories and made it dull , lifeless , and irritating .
>2
this loud and thoroughly obnoxious comedy about a pair of squabbling workingclass spouses is a deeply unpleasant experience .
>1
it s better than the phantom menace .
>2
but unless you re an absolute raving star wars junkie , it is nt much fun .
>2
philosophically , intellectually and logistically a mess .
>2
a standard policeoriented drama that , were it not for de niro s participation , would have likely wound up a tnt original .
>2
coupling disgracefully written dialogue with flailing bodily movements that substitute for acting , circuit is the awkwardly paced soap operaish story .
>2
hollywood ending just is nt very funny .
>2
though clearly wellintentioned , this crosscultural soap opera is painfully formulaic and stilted .
>2
a technical triumph and an extraordinary bore .
>1
i can easily imagine benigni s pinocchio becoming a christmas perennial .
>2
coal is nt as easy to come by as it used to be and this would be a worthy substitute for naughty children s stockings .
>2
two hours of junk .
>2
a clumsily manufactured exploitation flick , a stylefree exercise in manipulation and mayhem .
>2
what s missing is what we call the  wow  factor .
>2
... tara reid plays a college journalist , but she looks like the sixtime winner of the miss hawaiian tropic pageant , so i do nt know what she s doing in here ...
>2
the young stars are too cute  the story and ensuing complications are too manipulative  the message is too blatant  the resolutions are too convenient .
>2
normally , rohmer s talky films fascinate me , but when he moves his setting to the past , and relies on a historical text , he loses the richness of characterization that makes his films so memorable .
>2
it s been 13 months and 295 preview screenings since i last walked out on a movie , but resident evil really earned my indignant , preemptive departure .
>2
this picture is mostly a lump of runofthemill profanity sprinkled with a few remarks so geared toward engendering audience sympathy that you might think he was running for office  or trying to win over a probation officer .
>2
but the movie s narrative hook is way too muddled to be an effectively chilling guilty pleasure .
>1
though it goes further than both , anyone who has seen the hunger or cat people will find little new here , but a tasty performance from vincent gallo lifts this tale of cannibal lust above the ordinary .
>2
a blair witch  style adventure that plays like a bad soap opera , with passable performances from everyone in the cast .
>2
diaz wears out her welcome in her most charmless performance
>2
it is too bad that this likable movie is nt more accomplished .
>2
the actors try hard but come off too amateurish and awkward .
>2
the plot has a number of holes , and at times it s simply baffling .
>2
an illconceived jumble that s not scary , not smart and not engaging .
>2
brainless , but enjoyably overthetop , the retro gang melodrama , deuces wild represents fifties teengang machismo in a way that borders on roughtrade homoeroticism .
>2
gets bogged down by an overly sillified plot and stopandstart pacing .
>2
like coming into a longrunning , wellwritten television series where you ve missed the first halfdozen episodes and probably wo nt see the next six .
>2
dripping with cliche and bypassing no opportunity to trivialize the material .
>2
hardcore slasher aficionados will find things to like ... but overall the halloween series has lost its edge .
>2
stiff and schmaltzy and clumsily directed .
>2
the story the movie tells is of brian de palma s addiction to the junkcalorie suspense tropes that have all but ruined his career .
>2
with tiny little jokes and nary an original idea , this sappy ethnic sleeper proves that not only blockbusters pollute the summer movie pool .
>2
it sticks rigidly to the paradigm , rarely permitting its characters more than two obvious dimensions and repeatedly placing them in contrived , wellworn situations .
>2
ever see one of those comedies that just seem like a bad idea from frame one ?
>2
once icet sticks his mug in the window of the couple s bmw and begins haranguing the wife in bad stage dialogue , all credibility flies out the window .
>2
quitting , however , manages just to be depressing , as the lead actor phones in his autobiographical performance .
>2
it would be great to see this turd squashed under a truck , preferably a semi .
>2
for most movies , 84 minutes is short , but this one feels like a life sentence .
>2
shatner is probably the funniest person in the film , which gives you an idea just how bad it was .
>2
tries so hard to be quirky and funny that the strain is all too evident .
>1
as immaculate as stuart little 2 is , it could be a lot better if it were , well , more adventurous .
>2
simply a rehash of the other seven films .
>2
with jump cuts , fast editing and lots of pyrotechnics , yu clearly hopes to camouflage how bad his movie is .
>2
he fails .
>2
a very depressing movie of many missed opportunities .
>2
goes on and on to the point of nausea .
>2
by turns numbingly dullwitted and disquietingly creepy .
>2
boy , has this franchise ever run out of gas .
>2
one problem with the movie , directed by joel schumacher , is that it jams too many prefabricated story elements into the running time .
>2
the comedy is nonexistent .
>2
... a bland , pretentious mess .
>2
it s a pedestrian , flat drama that screams out  amateur  in almost every frame .
>2
a bland animated sequel that hardly seems worth the effort .
>2
it s not just the vampires that are damned in queen of the damned  the viewers will feel they suffer the same fate .
>2
if religious films are nt your bailiwick , stay away .
>2
otherwise , this could be a passable date film .

the director , with his fake backdrops and stately pacing , never settles on a consistent tone .

instead of panoramic sweep , kapur gives us episodic choppiness , undermining the story s emotional thrust .
>2
the movie does nt think much of its characters , its protagonist , or of us .

after seeing the film , i can tell you that there s no other reason why anyone should bother remembering it .

as a kind of colorful , dramatized pbs program , frida gets the job done .

with minimal imagination , you could restage the whole thing in your bathtub .

friday after next is the kind of film that could only be made by africanamericans because of its broad racial insensitivity towards africanamericans .

... stylistically , the movie is a disaster .

busy urban comedy is clearly not zhang s forte , his directorial touch is neither light nor magical enough to bring off this kind of whimsy .

a movie that ca nt get sufficient distance from leroy s delusions to escape their maudlin influence .

louiso lets the movie dawdle in classic disaffectedindiefilm mode , and brother hoffman s script stumbles over a lateinning twist that just does nt make sense .
>2
the movie straddles the fence between escapism and social commentary , and on both sides it falls short .

the film is oldfashioned , occasionally charming and as subtle as boldface .

he s not good with people .

patchy combination of soap opera , lowtech magic realism and , at times , ploddingly sociological commentary .

so boring that even its target audience talked all the way through it .
>2
one of the more glaring signs of this movie s servitude to its superstar is the way it skirts around any scenes that might have required genuine acting from ms. spears .

hollywood ending is the most disappointing woody allen movie ever .

he has a great cast and a great idea .

it s just hard to believe that a life like this can sound so dull .

ringu is a disaster of a story , full of holes and completely lacking in chills .
>2
ignore the reputation , and ignore the film .

this one is a few bits funnier than malle s dud , if only because the cast is so engagingly messing around like slob city reductions of damon runyon crooks .

 it s painful to watch witherspoon s talents wasting away inside unnecessary films like legally blonde and sweet home abomination , i mean , alabama .

a plodding teen remake that s so mechanical you can smell the grease on the plot twists .

trying to figure out the rules of the country bear universe  when are bears bears and when are they like humans , only hairier  would tax einstein s brain .

even in terms of the lowgrade cheese standards on which it operates , it never quite makes the grade as tawdry trash .
>2
rife with nutty cliches and far too much dialogue .
>2
too intensely focused on the travails of being hal hartley to function as pastiche , no such thing is hartley s least accessible screed yet .
>2
director uwe boll and writer robert dean klein fail to generate any interest in an unsympathetic hero caught up in an intricate plot that while cleverly worked out , can not overcome blah characters .

ms. phoenix is completely lacking in charm and charisma , and is unable to project either esther s initial anomie or her eventual awakening .

the movie fails to portray its literarily talented and notorious subject as anything much more than a dirty old man .

while it is welcome to see a chinese film depict a homosexual relationship in a mature and frank fashion , lan yu never catches dramatic fire .
>2
the script boasts some tart tvinsider humor , but the film has not a trace of humanity or empathy .
>2
the original was nt a good movie but this remake makes it look like a masterpiece !
>2
one suspects that craven endorses they simply because this movie makes his own look much better by comparison .
>2
includes too much obvious padding .
>2
there s no palpable chemistry between lopez and male lead ralph fiennes , plus the script by working girl scribe kevin wade is workmanlike in the extreme .

i m not sure which half of dragonfly is worse  the part where nothing s happening , or the part where something s happening , but it s stupid .
>2
the only camouflage carvey should now be considering is a paper bag to wear over his head when he goes out into public , to avoid being recognized as the man who bilked unsuspecting moviegoers .
>2
shot like a postcard and overacted with all the boozy selfindulgence that brings out the worst in otherwise talented actors ...
>2
spain s greatest star wattage does nt overcome the tumult of maudlin tragedy .
>2
conforms itself with creating a game of  who s who  ... where the characters  moves are often more predictable than their consequences .
>2
looks and feels like a lowbudget hybrid of scarface or carlito s way .
>2
the script is a tired one , with few moments of joy rising above the stale material .
>2
suffers from all the excesses of the genre .
>2
the verdict  two bodies and hardly a laugh between them .

the latest adam sandler assault and possibly the worst film of the year .
>1
downbeat , periodperfect biopic hammers home a heavyhanded moralistic message .
>2
while the film is competent , it s also uninspired , lacking the real talent and wit to elevate it beyond its formula to the level of classic romantic comedy to which it aspires .
>2
they ought to be a whole lot scarier than they are in this tepid genre offering .
>2
but it s hard to imagine a more generic effort in the genre .
>2
it s just plain lurid when it is nt downright silly .
>2
pap invested in undergraduate doubling subtexts and ridiculous stabs at existentialism reminding of the discovery of the wizard of god in the fifth trek flick .
>2
a horror movie with seriously dumb characters , which somewhat dilutes the pleasure of watching them stalked by creepycrawly bug things that live only in the darkness .
>2
it s a film with an idea buried somewhere inside its fabric , but never clearly seen or felt .
>2
a movie in which two not very absorbing characters are engaged in a romance you ca nt wait to see end .
>2
the predominantly amateur cast is painful to watch , so stilted and unconvincing are the performances .
>2
they re the unnamed , easily substitutable forces that serve as whatever terror the heroes of horror movies try to avoid .
>1
,  they re out there ! 
>2
elegantly crafted but emotionally cold , a puzzle whose intricate construction one can admire but is difficult to connect with on any deeper level .

were dylan thomas alive to witness firsttime director ethan hawke s strained chelsea walls , he might have been tempted to change his landmark poem to ,  do not go gentle into that good theatre . 
>2
the story has its redundancies , and the young actors , not very experienced , are sometimes inexpressive .
>2
i m sure the filmmaker would disagree , but , honestly , i do nt see the point .
>2
it s a visual rorschach test and i must have failed .
>2
the film is really closer to porn than a serious critique of what s wrong with this increasingly pervasive aspect of gay culture .
>2
murder by numbers just does nt add up .
>2
clare peploe s airless movie adaptation could use a little american pielike irreverence .
>2
video games are more involving than this mess .

a pale xerox of other , better crime movies .

illiterate , often inert scifi action thriller .

a perfect example of rancid , wellintentioned , but shamelessly manipulative movie making .
>2
the adventure does nt contain half the excitement of balto , or quarter the fun of toy story 2 .
>1
essentially a collection of bits  and they re all naughty .
>2
the screenplay does too much meandering , norton has to recite bland police procedural details , fiennes wanders around in an attempt to seem weird and distanced , hopkins looks like a drag queen .
>2
the screenplay by james eric , james horton and director peter ofallon ... is so pat it makes your teeth hurt .
>1
before it takes a sudden turn and devolves into a bizarre sort of romantic comedy , steven shainberg s adaptation of mary gaitskill s harrowing short story ... is a brilliantly played , deeply unsettling experience .
>1
solaris is rigid and evasive in ways that soderbergh s best films ,  erin brockovich ,   out of sight  and  ocean s eleven ,  never were .
>2
seems like something american and european gay movies were doing 20 years ago .
>2
in the process of trimming the movie to an expeditious 84 minutes , director roger kumble seems to have dumped a whole lot of plot in favor of ... outrageous gags .
>2
thumbs down .
>2
the characters are paper thin and the plot is so cliched and contrived that it makes your least favorite james bond movie seem as cleverly plotted as the usual suspects .
>2
... del toro maintains a dark mood that makes the film seem like something to endure instead of enjoy .

the movie eventually snaps under the strain of its plot contrivances and its need to reassure .

too predictably , in fact .

alternative medicine obviously has its merits ... but ayurveda does the field no favors .
>2
this thing works on no level whatsoever for me .
>2
an incoherent jumble of a film that s rarely as entertaining as it could have been .
>2
more dutiful than enchanting ... terribly episodic and lacking the spark of imagination that might have made it an exhilarating treat .
>2
laconic and very stilted in its dialogue , this indie flick never found its audience , probably because it s extremely hard to relate to any of the characters .
>2
the comedy death to smoochy is a rancorous curiosity  a movie without an apparent audience .
>2
barney s ideas about creation and identity do nt really seem all that profound , at least by way of what can be gleaned from this threehour endurance test built around an hour s worth of actual material .
>2
cinematic pyrotechnics aside , the only thing avary seems to care about are mean giggles and pulchritude .
>2
nothing more or less than an outright bodiceripper  it should have ditched the artsy pretensions and revelled in the entertaining shallows .
>1
a living testament to the power of the eccentric and the strange .
>2
the fact that it is nt very good is almost beside the point .
>2
feels less like a cousin to blade runner than like a bottomfeeder sequel in the escape from new york series .
>2
what might have been acceptable on the printed page of iles  book does not translate well to the screen .
>2
if oscar had a category called best bad film you thought was going to be really awful but was nt , guys would probably be duking it out with the queen of the damned for the honor .

a poky and pseudoserious exercise in sham actor workshops and an affected malaise .

fessenden has nurtured his metaphors at the expense of his narrative , but he does display an original talent .

fear dot com is more frustrating than a modem that disconnects every 10 seconds .
>2
full of flatulence jokes and mild sexual references , kung pow !
>2
is the kind of movie that s criticproof , simply because it aims so low .
>2
may cause you to bite your tongue to keep from laughing at the ridiculous dialog or the ohso convenient plot twists .
>2
there are just too many characters saying too many clever things and getting into too many pointless situations .
>2
where s the movie here ?
>2
lacking substance and soul , crossroads comes up shorter than britney s cutoffs .
>2
cassavetes thinks he s making dog day afternoon with a cause , but all he s done is to reduce everything he touches to a shrill , didactic cartoon .
>2
buries an interesting storyline about morality and the choices we make underneath such a mountain of clichs and borrowed images that it might more accurately be titled mr. chips off the old block .
>2
although sensitive to a fault , it s often overwritten , with a surfeit of weighty revelations , flowery dialogue , and nostalgia for the past and roads not taken .
>2
it s so badly made on every level that i m actually having a hard time believing people were paid to make it .
>2
without nonstop techno or the existential overtones of a kieslowski morality tale , maelstrm is just another winter sleepers .
>2
nicks , seemingly uncertain what s going to make people laugh , runs the gamut from stale parody to raunchy sex gags to formula romantic comedy .
>2
if there s one thing this world needs less of , it s movies about college that are written and directed by people who could nt pass an entrance exam .
>2
the script kicks in , and mr. hartley s distended pace and footdragging rhythms follow .
>2
i am sorry that i was unable to get the full brunt of the comedy .
>2
no telegraphing is too obvious or simplistic for this movie .
>2
looks and feels like a project better suited for the small screen .
>2
in its best moments , resembles a bad high school production of grease , without benefit of song .
>2
indifferently implausible popcorn programmer of a movie .
>2
it s inoffensive , cheerful , built to inspire the young people , set to an unending soundtrack of beach party pop numbers and aside from its remarkable camerawork and awesome scenery , it s about as exciting as a sunburn .
>2
his comedy premises are often hackneyed or just plain crude , calculated to provoke shocked laughter , without following up on a deeper level .
>2
at times , the suspense is palpable , but by the end there s a sense that the crux of the mystery hinges on a technicality that strains credulity and leaves the viewer haunted by the waste of potential .
>2
they should have called it gutterball .
>1
thekids will probably stay amused at the kaleidoscope of big , colorful characters .
>2
it s too selfimportant and plodding to be funny , and too clipped and abbreviated to be an epic .
>2
the best that can be said about the work here of scottish director ritchie ... is that he obviously does nt have his heart in it .

less dizzying than just dizzy , the jaunt is practically over before it begins .

slick piece of crosspromotion .
>2
taylor appears to have blown his entire budget on soundtrack rights and had nothing left over for jokes .
>2
it all drags on so interminably it s like watching a miserable relationship unfold in real time .
>2
it s another video movie photographed like a film , with the bad lighting that s often written off as indie film naturalism .
>2
i got a headache watching this meaningless downer .
>2
too much of the humor falls flat .
>2
detox is ultimately a pointless endeavor .
>2
the piquant story needs more dramatic meat on its bones .
>2
very special effects , brilliantly bold colors and heightened reality ca nt hide the giant achilles  heel in  stuart little 2   there s just no story , folks .
>2
no way i can believe this load of junk .
>2
it s dumb , but more importantly , it s just not scary .
>2
there is no pleasure in watching a child suffer .
>2
just embarrassment and a vague sense of shame .
>2
the movie s accumulated force still feels like an ugly knot tightening in your stomach .
>2
even with a green mohawk and a sheet of firered flame tattoos covering his shoulder , however , kilmer seems to be posing , rather than acting .
>2
and that leaves a hole in the center of the salton sea .
>2
when the film ended , i felt tired and drained and wanted to lie on my own deathbed for a while .
>2
the film s hackneyed message is not helped by the thin characterizations , nonexistent plot and pretentious visual style .
>2
the iditarod lasts for days  this just felt like it did .
>2
it feels like an afterschool special gussied up with some fancy special effects , and watching its rote plot points connect is about as exciting as gazing at an egg timer for 93 minutes .
>2
this movie is maddening .
>2
should have been someone else 
>2
the film is based on truth and yet there is something about it that feels incomplete , as if the real story starts just around the corner .
>2
why make a documentary about these marginal historical figures ?
>2
the lower your expectations , the more you ll enjoy it .
>2
rarely has leukemia looked so shimmering and benign .
>2
... is an arthritic attempt at directing by callie khouri .
>2
i had to look away  this was god awful .
>2
velocity represents everything wrong with  independent film  as a commodified , soldout concept on the american filmmaking scene .
>2
just one bad idea after another .
>2
because of an unnecessary and clumsy last scene ,  swimfan  left me with a very bad feeling .
>2
though moonlight mile is replete with acclaimed actors and actresses and tackles a subject that s potentially moving , the movie is too predictable and too selfconscious to reach a level of high drama .
>2
corpus collosum  while undeniably interesting  wore out its welcome well before the end credits rolled about 45 minutes in .
>2
the last 20 minutes are somewhat redeeming , but most of the movie is the same teenage american roadtrip drek we ve seen before  only this time you have to read the fart jokes
>2
it s hard to like a film about a guy who is utterly unlikeable , and shiner , starring michael caine as an aging british boxing promoter desperate for a taste of fame and fortune , is certainly that .
>2
a bythenumbers effort that wo nt do much to enhance the franchise .
>2
involves two mysteries  one it gives away and the other featuring such badly drawn characters that its outcome hardly matters .
>2
overall the film feels like a lowbudget tv pilot that could not find a buyer to play it on the tube .
>2
it s of the quality of a lesser harrison ford movie  six days , seven nights , maybe , or that dreadful sabrina remake .
>2
it appears that something has been lost in the translation to the screen .
>2
despite all evidence to the contrary , this clunker has somehow managed to pose as an actual feature movie , the kind that charges full admission and gets hyped on tv and purports to amuse small children and ostensible adults .
>2
an unclassifiably awful study in self  and audienceabuse .
>2
this movie is something of an impostor itself , stretching and padding its material in a blur of dead ends and distracting camera work .
>2
this one is definitely one to skip , even for horror movie fanatics .
>2
excessive , profane , packed with cartoonish violence and comicstrip characters .
>2
once the 50 year old benigni appears as the title character , we find ourselves longing for the block of wood to come back .
>1
a working class  us vs. them  opera that leaves no heartstring untugged and no liberal cause unplundered .
>2
if the movie succeeds in instilling a wary sense of  there but for the grace of god ,  it is far too selfconscious to draw you deeply into its world .
>2
there are simply too many ideas floating around  part farce , part sliding doors , part pop video  and yet failing to exploit them .
>2
it takes a strange kind of laziness to waste the talents of robert forster , anne meara , eugene levy , and reginald veljohnson all in the same movie .
>1
we have nt seen such hilarity since say it is nt so !
>2
expect the sameold , lameold slasher nonsense , just with different scenery .
>2
the cold turkey would ve been a far better title .
>2
the reality of the new liveaction pinocchio he directed , cowrote and starred in borders on the grotesque .
>2
zaidan s script has barely enough plot to string the stunts together and not quite enough characterization to keep the faces straight .
>2
try as i may , i ca nt think of a single good reason to see this movie , even though everyone in my group extemporaneously shouted ,  thank you ! 
>2
when leguizamo finally plugged an irritating character late in the movie .

a valueless kiddie paean to pro basketball underwritten by the nba .
>2
impostor has a handful of thrilling moments and a couple of good performances , but the movie does nt quite fly .
>2
for starters , the story is just too slim .
>1
so much facile technique , such cute ideas , so little movie .
>2
the experience of going to a film festival is a rewarding one  the experiencing of sampling one through this movie is not .
>2
it has its moments of swaggering camaraderie , but more often just feels generic , derivative and done to death .
>2
almost gags on its own gore .
>2
how do you spell clich ?
>1
it s sweet , harmless , dumb , occasionally funny and about as compelling as a fishing show .
>2
the moviegoing equivalent of going to a dinner party and being forced to watch the host and hostess s home video of their baby s birth .
>2
in the real world , an actor this uncharismatically beautiful would have a rsum loaded with credits like  girl in bar  3 . 
>2
too much of it feels unfocused and underdeveloped .
>1
a giggle a minute .
>2
big fat waste of time .
>2
the movie is what happens when you blow up small potatoes to 10 times their natural size , and it ai nt pretty .
>2
sometimes seems less like storytelling than something the otherwise compelling director needed to get off his chest .
>2
this is not the undisputed worst boxing movie ever , but it s certainly not a champion  the big loser is the audience .
>2
you really have to wonder how on earth anyone , anywhere could have thought they d make audiences guffaw with a script as utterly diabolical as this .
>2
in the end , we are left with something like two ships passing in the night rather than any insights into gay love , chinese society or the price one pays for being dishonest .
>2
chokes on its own depiction of uppercrust decorum .
>2
wellnigh unendurable ... though the picture strains to become cinematic poetry , it remains depressingly prosaic and dull .
>2
i thought my own watch had stopped keeping time as i slogged my way through clockstoppers .
>2
unfortunately , it s not silly fun unless you enjoy really bad movies .
>2
the longer the movie goes , the worse it gets , but it s actually pretty good in the first few minutes .
>2
not only unfunny , but downright repellent .
>2
care deftly captures the wonder and menace of growing up , but he never really embraces the joy of fuhrman s destructive escapism or the graceinrebellion found by his characters .
>2
forced , familiar and thoroughly condescending .
>2
does little more than play an innocuous game of fillin  theblanks with a tragic past .
>2
k19 exploits our substantial collective fear of nuclear holocaust to generate cheap hollywood tension .
>2
whaley s determination to immerse you in sheer , unrelenting wretchedness is exhausting .
>2
uncommonly stylish but equally silly ... the picture fails to generate much suspense , nor does it ask searching enough questions to justify its pretensions .
>2
the entire movie is about a boring , sad man being boring and sad .
>2
the plot convolutions ultimately add up to nothing more than jerking the audience s chain .
>2
confirms the nagging suspicion that ethan hawke would be even worse behind the camera than he is in front of it .
>2
made with no discernible craft and monstrously sanctimonious in dealing with childhood loss .
>2
holden caulfield did it better .
>2
a synthesis of cliches and absurdities that seems positively decadent in its cinematic flash and emptiness .
>2
oh come on .
>2
like you could nt smell this turkey rotting from miles away .
>2
not exactly the bees knees
>2
it does nothing new with the old story , except to show fisticuffs in this sort of stopgo slow motion that makes the gang rumbles look like they re being streamed over a 28k modem .
>2
the film contains no good jokes , no good scenes , barely a moment when carvey s saturday night livehoned mimicry rises above the level of embarrassment .
>2
chabrol has taken promising material for a black comedy and turned it instead into a somber chamber drama .
>2
it s as if you re watching a movie that was made in 1978 but not released then because it was so weak , and it has been unearthed and released now , when it has become even weaker .
>2
in execution , this clever idea is far less funny than the original , killers from space .
>2
one of the more irritating cartoons you will see this , or any , year .
>2
a broad , melodramatic estrogen opera that s pretty toxic in its own right .
>2
too slow , too long and too little happens .
>2
the film s few ideas are stretched to the point of evaporation  the whole central section is one big chase that seems to have no goal and no urgency .
>2
it s just filler .
>2
sacrifices the value of its wealth of archival footage with its lessthanobjective stance .
>2
utterly lacking in charm , wit and invention , roberto benigni s pinocchio is an astonishingly bad film .
>2
a hamfisted romantic comedy that makes our girl the hapless facilitator of an extended cheap shot across the masondixon line .
>2
scores no points for originality , wit , or intelligence .
>2
it s a cookiecutter movie , a cutandpaste job .
>2
they takes a long time to get to its gaspinducing ending .
>2
even on those rare occasions when the narrator stops yammering , miller s hand often feels unsure .
>2
pumpkin means to be an outrageous dark satire on fraternity life , but its ambitions far exceed the abilities of writer adam larson broder and his codirector , tony r. abrams , in their feature debut .
>1
at its best , queen is campy fun like the vincent price horror classics of the 60s .
>2
at its worst , it implodes in a series of very bad special effects .
>2
from the opening scenes , it s clear that all about the benjamins is a totally formulaic movie .
>2
it takes a certain kind of horror movie to qualify as  worse than expected ,  but ghost ship somehow manages to do exactly that .
>2
by getting myself wrapped up in the visuals and eccentricities of many of the characters , i found myself confused when it came time to get to the heart of the movie .
>2
too often , the viewer is nt reacting to humor so much as they are wincing back in repugnance .
>2
manages to show life in all of its banality when the intention is quite the opposite .
>2
do not see this film .
>1
minority report is exactly what the title indicates , a report .
>2
delivers the same old same old , tarted up with latin flava and turned out by hollywood playas .
>2
if you believe any of this , i can make you a real deal on leftover enron stock that will double in value a week from friday .
>2
to call the other side of heaven  appalling  would be to underestimate just how dangerous entertainments like it can be .
>2
in exactly 89 minutes , most of which passed as slowly as if i d been sitting naked on an igloo , formula 51 sank from quirky to jerky to utter turkey .
>2
i d have to say the star and director are the big problems here .
>2
without the dark spookiness of crystal lake camp , the horror concept completely loses its creepy menace .
>2
while the resident evil games may have set new standards for thrills , suspense , and gore for video games , the movie really only succeeds in the third of these .
>2
for close to two hours the audience is forced to endure three terminally depressed , mostly inarticulate , hyper dysfunctional families for the price of one .
>2
what the director ca nt do is make either of val kilmer s two personas interesting or worth caring about .
>2
in an effort , i suspect , not to offend by appearing either too serious or too lighthearted , it offends by just being wishywashy .
>2
it s difficult to imagine the process that produced such a script , but here s guessing that spray cheese and underarm noises played a crucial role .
>2
... nothing scary here except for some awful acting and lame special effects .
>2
it s not that kung pow is nt funny some of the time  it just is nt any funnier than bad martial arts movies are all by themselves , without all oedekerk s impish augmentation .
>2
a very long movie , dull in stretches , with entirely too much focus on meal preparation and igloo construction .
>2
not an objectionable or dull film  it merely lacks everything except good intentions .
>2
a sciencefiction pastiche so lacking in originality that if you stripped away its inspirations there would be precious little left .
>2
the words ,  frankly , my dear , i do nt give a damn ,  have never been more appropriate .
>2
all the ampedup tony hawkstyle stunts and thrashing rapmetal ca nt disguise the fact that , really , we ve been here , done that .
>2
a sequel that s much too big for its britches .
>2
so unremittingly awful that labeling it a dog probably constitutes cruelty to canines .
>2
what was once original has been coopted so frequently that it now seems pedestrian .
>2
for all the writhing and wailing , tears , rage and opium overdoses , there s no sense of actual passion being washed away in love s dissolution .
>2
a coarse and stupid grossout .
>2
a nightmare date with a halfformed wit done a great disservice by a lack of critical distance and a sad trust in liberal arts college bumper sticker platitudes .
>2
does nt offer much besides glib soullessness , raunchy language and a series of brutal set pieces ... that raise the bar on stylized screen violence .
>2
it s one pussyass world when even killerthrillers revolve around group therapy sessions .
>2
rarely has so much money delivered so little entertainment .
>2
tries to add some spice to its quirky sentiments but the taste is all too familiar .
>2
paid in full is so stale , in fact , that its most vibrant scene is one that uses clips from brian de palma s scarface .
>2
that s a cheat .
>1
harrison s flowers puts its heart in the right place , but its brains are in no particular place at all .
>2
this redo is so dumb and so exploitative in its violence that , ironically , it becomes everything that the rather clumsy original was railing against .
>2
a string of rehashed sight gags based in insipid vulgarity .
>2
the movie is dawn of the dead crossed with john carpenter s ghosts of mars , with zombies not as ghoulish as the first and trains not as big as the second .
>2
too restrained to be a freak show , too mercenary and obvious to be cerebral , too dull and pretentious to be engaging ... the isle defies an easy categorization .
>1
it s one of those baseball pictures where the hero is stoic , the wife is patient , the kids are as cute as all getout and the odds against success are long enough to intimidate , but short enough to make a dream seem possible .
>2
 the time machine  is a movie that has no interest in itself .
>2
it does nt believe in itself , it has no sense of humor ... it s just plain bored .
>2
... a hollow joke told by a cinematic gymnast having too much fun embellishing the misanthropic tale to actually engage it .
>1
it s about following your dreams , no matter what your parents think .
>2
it has all the excitement of eating oatmeal .
>2
i ll bet the video game is a lot more fun than the film .
>2
winceinducing dialogue , thriftshop costumes , prosthetic makeup by silly putty and kmart bluelightspecial effects all conspire to test trekkie loyalty .
>2
i do nt mind having my heartstrings pulled , but do nt treat me like a fool .
>2
... although this idea is  new  the results are tired .
>1
i m guessing the director is a magician .
>2
after all , he took three minutes of dialogue , 30 seconds of plot and turned them into a 90minute movie that feels five hours long .
>2
an unencouraging threefold expansion on the former mtv series , accompanying the stunthungry dimwits in a random series of collected gags , pranks , pratfalls , dares , injuries , etc. .
>2
for all its impressive craftsmanship , and despite an overbearing series of thirdact crescendos , lily chouchou never really builds up a head of emotional steam .
>2
do nt be fooled by the impressive cast list  eye see you is pure junk .
>2
not since freddy got fingered has a major release been so painful to sit through .
>2
plays like a volatile and overlong w magazine fashion spread .
>2
a better title , for all concerned , might be swept under the rug .
>2
this movie seems to have been written using madlibs .
>1
hilariously inept and ridiculous .
>2
vera s technical prowess ends up selling his film short  he smoothes over hard truths even as he uncovers them .
>2
feels too formulaic and too familiar to produce the transgressive thrills of early underground work .
>2
given how heavyhanded and portentheavy it is , this could be the worst thing soderbergh has ever done .
>2
a bythenumbers patientdoctor pic that covers all the usual ground
>2
a dumb movie with dumb characters doing dumb things and you have to be really dumb not to see where this is going .
>2
stealing harvard aspires to comedic grand larceny but stands convicted of nothing more than petty theft of your time .
>1
for this reason and this reason only  the power of its own steadfast , hoitytoity convictions  chelsea walls deserves a medal .
>2
with the exception of some fleetingly amusing improvisations by cedric the entertainer as perry s boss , there is nt a redeeming moment here .
>2
it s a grab bag of genres that do nt add up to a whole lot of sense .
>2
movie fans , get ready to take off ... the other direction .
>2
all that s missing is the spontaneity , originality and delight .
>2
no one but a convict guilty of some truly heinous crime should have to sit through the master of disguise .
>2
even the finest chef ca nt make a hotdog into anything more than a hotdog , and robert de niro ca nt make this movie anything more than a trashy cop buddy comedy .
>2
there s too much falseness to the second half , and what began as an intriguing look at youth fizzles into a dull , ridiculous attempt at hearttugging .
>1
miller is playing so free with emotions , and the fact that children are hostages to fortune , that he makes the audience hostage to his swaggering affectation of seriousness .
>2
despite the evocative aesthetics evincing the hollow state of modern love life , the film never percolates beyond a monotonous whine .
>2
it s slow  very , very slow .
>2
it s not the ultimate depressionera gangster movie .
>2
that s pure pr hype .
>2
characters still need to function according to some set of believable and comprehensible impulses , no matter how many drugs they do or how much artistic license avary employs .
>2
comes ... uncomfortably close to coasting in the treads of the bicycle thief .
>2
visually rather stunning , but ultimately a handsomelooking bore , the true creativity would have been to hide treasure planet entirely and completely reimagine it .
>2
stealing harvard is evidence that the farrelly bros.  peter and bobby  and their brand of screen comedy are wheezing to an end , along with green s halfhearted movie career .
>2
there seems to be no clear path as to where the story s going , or how long it s going to take to get there .
>2
i do nt think i laughed out loud once .
>2
and when you re talking about a slapstick comedy , that s a pretty big problem .
>2
it s so mediocre , despite the dynamic duo on the marquee , that we just ca nt get no satisfaction .
>2
slapstick buffoonery can tickle many a preschooler s fancy , but when it costs a family of four about  40 to see a film in theaters , why spend money on a dog like this when you can rent a pedigree instead ?
>2
... turns so unforgivably trite in its last 10 minutes that anyone without a fortified sweet tooth will likely go into sugar shock .
>2
the notion that bombing buildings is the funniest thing in the world goes entirely unexamined in this startlingly unfunny comedy .
>2
my reaction in a word  disappointment .
>2
his last movie was poetically romantic and full of indelible images , but his latest has nothing going for it .
>2
sustains its dreamlike glide through a succession of cheesy coincidences and voluptuous cheap effects , not the least of which is rebecca romijnstamos .
>1
intriguing documentary which is emotionally diluted by focusing on the story s least interesting subject .
>2
feels haphazard , as if the writers mistakenly thought they could achieve an air of frantic spontaneity by simply tossing in lots of characters doing silly stuff and stirring the pot .
>2
for each chuckle there are at least 10 complete misses , many coming from the amazingly lifelike tara reid , whose acting skills are comparable to a cardboard cutout .
>2
in its own way , joshua is as blasphemous and nonsensical as a luis buuel film without the latter s attendant intelligence , poetry , passion , and genius .
>2
i ve always dreamed of attending cannes , but after seeing this film , it s not that big a deal .
>2
it can not be enjoyed , even on the level that one enjoys a bad slasher flick , primarily because it is dull .
>2
yes , dull .
>2
director uwe boll and the actors provide scant reason to care in this crude 70s throwback .
>2
outerspace buffs might love this film , but others will find its pleasures intermittent .
>2
this piece of channel 5 grade trash is , quite frankly , an insult to the intelligence of the true genre enthusiast .
>2
an occasionally funny , but overall limp , fishoutofwater story .
>2
a bloated gasbag thesis grotesquely impressed by its own gargantuan aura of selfimportance ...
>2
as a rumor of angels reveals itself to be a sudsy tub of supernatural hokum , not even ms. redgrave s noblest efforts can redeem it from hopeless sentimentality .
>2
an appalling  ace ventura  ripoff that somehow manages to bring together kevin pollak , former wrestler chyna and dolly parton .
>2
if any of them list this  credit  on their resumes in the future , that ll be much funnier than anything in the film ...
>2
the humor is forced and heavyhanded , and occasionally simply unpleasant .
>2
as the latest bid in the tvtomovie franchise game , i spy makes its bigscreen entry with little of the nervy originality of its groundbreaking smallscreen progenitor .
>2
this is nt even madonna s swept away .
>2
the director knows how to apply textural gloss , but his portrait of sexaswar is strictly sitcom .
>2
burns never really harnesses to full effect the energetic cast .
>2
an overemphatic , wouldbe wacky , ultimately tedious sex farce .
>2
has all the depth of a wading pool .
>2
this is the sort of burly action flick where one coincidence pummels another , narrative necessity is a drunken roundhouse , and whatever passes for logic is a factor of the last plot device left standing .
>2
... the movie is just a plain old monster .
>2
one long string of cliches .
>2
fancy a real downer ?
>2
professionally speaking , it s tempting to jump ship in january to avoid ridiculous schlock like this shoddy suspense thriller .
>2
nelson s brutally unsentimental approach ... sucks the humanity from the film , leaving behind an horrific but weirdly unemotional spectacle .
>2
at once halfbaked and overheated .
>2
it s too bad that the helping hand he uses to stir his ingredients is also a heavy one .
>2
of course , by more objective measurements it s still quite bad .
>2
the only entertainment you ll derive from this choppy and sloppy affair will be from unintentional giggles  several of them .
>2
sam mendes has become valedictorian at the school for soft landings and easy ways out .
>2
its story may be a thousand years old , but why did it have to seem like it took another thousand to tell it to us ?
>2
the problem with this film is that it lacks focus .
>2
i sympathize with the plight of these families , but the movie does nt do a very good job conveying the issue at hand .
>2
dull , lifeless , and amateurishly assembled .
>2
puportedly  based on true events ,  a convolution of language that suggests it s impossible to claim that it is  based on a true story  with a straight face .
>2
... a plotline that s as lumpy as twoday old porridge ... the filmmakers  paws , sad to say , were all over this  unbearable  project !
>2
it s a bad thing when a movie has about as much substance as its end credits blooper reel .
>2
with its dogged hollywood naturalism and the inexorable passage of its characters toward sainthood , windtalkers is nothing but a stickysweet soap .
>2
no aspirations to social import inform the movie version .
>2
this is a shameless sham , calculated to cash in on the popularity of its stars .
>2
it s clear the filmmakers were nt sure where they wanted their story to go , and even more clear that they lack the skills to get us to this undetermined destination .
>2
as vulgar as it is banal .
>2
you wonder why enough was nt just a music video rather than a fulllength movie .
>2
the film s tone and pacing are off almost from the getgo .
>2
the talented and clever robert rodriguez perhaps put a little too much heart into his first film and did nt reserve enough for his second .
>2
more whiny downer than corruscating commentary .
>1
tambor and clayburgh make an appealing couple  he s understated and sardonic , she s appealingly manic and energetic .
>2
both deserve better .
>2
suffocated by its fussy script and uptight characters , this musty adaptation is all the more annoying since it s been packaged and sold back to us by hollywood .
>2
coughs and sputters on its own postmodern conceit .
>2
a wildly inconsistent emotional experience .
>2
sit through this one , and you wo nt need a magic watch to stop time  your dvd player will do it for you .
>2
a sometimes tedious film .
>2
teen movies have really hit the skids .
>2
there are plot holes big enough for shamu the killer whale to swim through .
>2
... plays like somebody spliced random moments of a chris rock routine into what is otherwise a clicheriddled but selfserious spy thriller .
>2
nasty , ugly , pointless and depressing , even if you hate clowns .
>2
what is 100  missing here is a script of even the most elemental literacy , an inkling of genuine wit , and anything resembling acting .
>1
does paint some memorable images ... , but makhmalbaf keeps her distance from the characters
>2
just not campy enough
>2
the movie , directed by mick jackson , leaves no cliche unturned , from the predictable plot to the characters straight out of central casting .
>2
it s everything you do nt go to the movies for .
>2
like watching a dress rehearsal the week before the show goes up  everything s in place but something s just a little offkilter .
>2
the affectionate loopiness that once seemed congenital to demme s perspective has a tough time emerging from between the badly dated cutesypie mystery scenario and the newfangled hollywood postproduction effects .
>2
for all its technical virtuosity , the film is so mired in juvenile and nearxenophobic pedagogy that it s enough to make one pine for the day when godard can no longer handle the rigors of filmmaking .
>2
american chai encourages rueful laughter at stereotypes only an indianamerican would recognize .
>2
and the lesson , in the end , is nothing new .
>2
it made me want to wrench my eyes out of my head and toss them at the screen .
>2
due to some script weaknesses and the casting of the director s brother , the film trails off into inconsequentiality .
>2
... plot holes so large and obvious a marching band might as well be stomping through them in clown clothes , playing a college football fight song on untuned instruments .
>2
so devoid of any kind of intelligible story that it makes films like xxx and collateral damage seem like thoughtful treatises
>2
combining quickcut editing and a blaring heavy metal much of the time , beck seems to be under the illusion that he s shooting the latest system of a down video .
>2
dragonfly has no atmosphere , no tension  nothing but costner , flailing away .
>2
it s a buggy drag .
>2
works hard to establish rounded characters , but then has nothing fresh or particularly interesting to say about them .
>2
the action switches between past and present , but the material link is too tenuous to anchor the emotional connections that purport to span a 125year divide .
>2
nonsensical , dull  cyberhorror  flick is a grim , hollow exercise in flat scares and bad acting .
>2
instead of hiding pinocchio from critics , miramax should have hidden it from everyone .
>2
manages to be both repulsively sadistic and mundane .
>2
a great ensemble cast ca nt lift this heartfelt enterprise out of the familiar .
>2
there ought to be a directing license , so that ed burns can have his revoked .
>1
the structure the film takes may find matt damon and ben affleck once again looking for residuals as this officially completes a good will hunting trilogy that was never planned .
>2
... a boring parade of talking heads and technical gibberish that will do little to advance the linux cause .
>2
green might want to hang onto that ski mask , as robbery may be the only way to pay for his next project .
>2
i can take infantile humor ... but this is the sort of infantile that makes you wonder about changing the director and writer s diapers .
>2
there is nt nearly enough fun here , despite the presence of some appealing ingredients .
>2
directed in a paintbynumbers manner .
>2
a lackluster , unessential sequel to the classic disney adaptation of j.m. barrie s peter pan .
>2
samira makhmalbaf s new film blackboards is much like the ethos of a stream of consciousness , although , it s unfortunate for the viewer that the thoughts and reflections coming through are torpid and banal
>1
... routine , harmless diversion and little else .
>2
late marriage s stiffness is unlikely to demonstrate the emotional clout to sweep u.s. viewers off their feet .
>2
this time mr. burns is trying something in the martin scorsese streetrealist mode , but his selfregarding sentimentality trips him up again .
>2
while there s something intrinsically funny about sir anthony hopkins saying  get in the car , bitch ,  this jerry bruckheimer production has little else to offer
>2
it s hampered by a lifetimechannel kind of plot and a lead actress who is out of her depth .
>2
 that the  true story  by which all the queen s men is allegedly  inspired  was a lot funnier and more deftly enacted than what s been cobbled together onscreen .
>2
is there a group of more selfabsorbed women than the mother and daughters featured in this film ?
>2
i do nt think so .
>2
nothing wrong with performances here , but the whiney characters bugged me .
>2
there is very little dread or apprehension , and though i like the creepy ideas , they are not executed with anything more than perfunctory skill .
>2
if you ve ever entertained the notion of doing what the title of this film implies , what sex with strangers actually shows may put you off the idea forever .
>2
in the end , the movie collapses on its shaky foundation despite the best efforts of director joe carnahan .
>2
adults will wish the movie were less simplistic , obvious , clumsily plotted and shallowly characterized .
>2
but what are adults doing in the theater at all ?
>2
sticky sweet sentimentality , clumsy plotting and a rosily myopic view of life in the wwiiera mississippi delta undermine this adaptation .
>2
it s another stale , killbynumbers flick , complete with bladethin characters and terrible , punladen dialogue .
>2
every time you look , sweet home alabama is taking another bummer of a wrong turn .
>2
partway through watching this saccharine , eastereggcolored concoction , you realize that it is made up of three episodes of a rejected tv show .
>2
the overall effect is less like a children s movie than a recruitment film for future hollywood sellouts .
>2
portentous and pretentious , the weight of water is appropriately titled , given the heavyhandedness of it drama .
>1
a fitfully amusing romp that , if nothing else , will appeal to fans of malcolm in the middle and its pubescent star , frankie muniz .
>2
jason x is positively antidarwinian  nine sequels and 400 years later , the teens are none the wiser and jason still kills on autopilot .
>2
to say this was done better in wilder s some like it hot is like saying the sun rises in the east .
>2
at the very least , if you do nt know anything about derrida when you walk into the theater , you wo nt know much more when you leave .
>2
as  chick flicks  go , this one is pretty miserable , resorting to stringpulling rather than legitimate character development and intelligent plotting .
>2
the only excitement comes when the credits finally roll and you get to leave the theater .
>2
there s no emotional pulse to solaris .
>2
it ca nt decide if it wants to be a mysterythriller , a romance or a comedy .
>2
the character of zigzag is not sufficiently developed to support a film constructed around him .
>2
one of those pictures whose promising , if rather precious , premise is undercut by amateurish execution .
>2
serving sara does nt serve up a whole lot of laughs .
>2
the most hopelessly monotonous film of the year , noteworthy only for the gimmick of being filmed as a single unbroken 87minute take .
>2
with virtually no interesting elements for an audience to focus on , chelsea walls is a tripleespresso endurance challenge .
>2
deadeningly dull , mired in convoluted melodrama , nonsensical jargon and stiffupperlip laboriousness .
>2
a misogynistic piece of filth that attempts to pass itself off as hip , young adult entertainment .
>2
the film makes a fatal mistake  it asks us to care about a young man whose only apparent virtue is that he is not quite as unpleasant as some of the people in his life .
>2
another inyourface wallow in the lower depths made by people who have never sung those blues .
>2
shaky closeups of turkeyonrolls , stubbly chins , liver spots , red noses and the filmmakers new bobbed do draw easy chuckles but lead nowhere .
>2
complete lack of originality , cleverness or even visible effort
>2
though perry and hurley make inspiring efforts to breathe life into the disjointed , haphazard script by jay scherick and david ronn , neither the actors nor director reginald hudlin can make it more than fitfully entertaining .
>1
something akin to a japanese alice through the looking glass , except that it seems to take itself far more seriously .
>2
it takes talent to make a lifeless movie about the most heinous man who ever lived .
>2
on the whole , the movie lacks wit , feeling and believability to compensate for its incessant coarseness and banality .
>2
the story and the friendship proceeds in such a way that you re watching a soap opera rather than a chronicle of the ups and downs that accompany lifelong friendships .
>2
offers very little genuine romance and even fewer laughs ... a sad sitcom of a movie , largely devoid of charm .
>2
makes for a pretty unpleasant viewing experience .
>2
the movie fails to live up to the sum of its parts .
>2
although huppert s intensity and focus has a raw exhilaration about it , the piano teacher is anything but fun .
>2
it showcases carvey s talent for voices , but not nearly enough and not without taxing every drop of one s patience to get to the good stuff .
>2
very bad .
>2
stultifyingly , dumbfoundingly , mindnumbingly bad .
>2
may reawaken discussion of the kennedy assassination but this fictional film looks made for cable rather than for the big screen .
>2
if looking for a thrilling scifi cinematic ride , do nt settle for this imposter .
>2
not really bad so much as distasteful  we need kidnapping suspense dramas right now like we need doomsday thrillers .
>2
the result is a gaudy bag of stale candy , something from a halloween that died .
>2
davis ... is so enamored of her own creation that she ca nt see how insufferable the character is .
>2
the man from elysian fields is a cold , blissless work that groans along thinking itself some important comment on how life throws us some beguiling curves .
>2
determined to be fun , and bouncy , with energetic musicals , the humor did nt quite engage this adult .
>2
but this films lacks the passion required to sell the material .
>1
a solid film ... but more conscientious than it is truly stirring .
>2
there s not enough here to justify the almost two hours .
>2
the x potion gives the quickly named blossom , bubbles and buttercup supernatural powers that include extraordinary strength and laserbeam eyes , which unfortunately do nt enable them to discern flimsy screenplays .
>2
perceptive in its vision of nascent industrialized world politics as a new art form , but far too clunky , didactic and saddled with scenes that seem simply an ill fit for this movie .
>2
verbinski implements every hackartist trick to give us the ookyspookies .
>1
mcconaughey s fun to watch , the dragons are okay , not much fire in the script .
>2
an unwise amalgam of broadcast news and vibes .
>2
hit and miss as far as the comedy goes and a big ole  miss in the way of story .
>2
trite , banal , cliched , mostly inoffensive .
>2
mattei is tiresomely grave and longwinded , as if circularity itself indicated profundity .
>2
it s not original , and , robbed of the element of surprise , it does nt have any huge laughs in its story of irresponsible cops who love to play pranks .
>2
it offers little beyond the momentary joys of pretty and weightless intellectual entertainment .
>2
a sequence of ridiculous shoot  em  up scenes .
>2
nothing in waking up in reno ever inspired me to think of its inhabitants as anything more than markers in a screenplay .
>2
i m just too bored to care .
>2
irwin is a man with enough charisma and audacity to carry a dozen films , but this particular result is ultimately held back from being something greater .
>2
not a stereotype is omitted nor a clich left unsaid .
>2
attempts by this ensemble film to impart a message are so heavyhanded that they instead pummel the audience .
>2
it all feels like a monty python sketch gone horribly wrong .
>2
nervous breakdowns are not entertaining .
>2
scorsese does nt give us a character worth giving a damn about .
>2
like being trapped at a perpetual frat party ... how can something so gross be so boring ?
>2
this is so bad .
>2
prurient playthings aside , there s little to love about this english trifle .
>2
this is a train wreck of an action film  a stupefying attempt by the filmmakers to forcefeed james bond into the mindless xxx mold and throw 40 years of cinematic history down the toilet in favor of bright flashes and loud bangs .
>2
the film flat lines when it should peak and is more missed opportunity and trifle than dark , decadent truffle .
>2
the heavyhanded film is almost laughable as a consequence .
>2
at least one scene is so disgusting that viewers may be hard pressed to retain their lunch .
>2
a disappointment for those who love alternate versions of the bard , particularly ones that involve deep fryers and hamburgers .
>2
the film tries too hard to be funny and tries too hard to be hip .
>2
the end result is a film that s neither .
>2
every nanosecond of the the new guy reminds you that you could be doing something else far more pleasurable .
>2
something like scrubbing the toilet .
>2
or emptying rat traps .
>2
or doing last year s taxes with your exwife .
>1
scooby dooby doo  and shaggy too  you both look and sound great .
>2
 but daphne , you re too buff  fred thinks he s tough  and velma  wow , you ve lost weight !
>2
is the time really ripe for a warmedover james bond adventure , with a village idiot as the 007 clone ?
>2
however it may please those who love movies that blare with pop songs , young science fiction fans will stomp away in disgust .
>2
the humor is nt as sharp , the effects not as innovative , nor the story as imaginative as in the original .
>2
but it could have been worse .
>2
some of their jokes work , but most fail miserably and in the end , pumpkin is far more offensive than it is funny .
>2
even horror fans will most likely not find what they re seeking with trouble every day  the movie lacks both thrills and humor .
>2
comes off like a rejected abc afterschool special , freshened up by the dunce of a screenwriting 101 class .
>2
... designed to provide a mix of smiles and tears ,  crossroads  instead provokes a handful of unintentional howlers and numerous yawns .
>2
it seems to me the film is about the art of ripping people off without ever letting them consciously know you have done so
>2
it s just disappointingly superficial  a movie that has all the elements necessary to be a fascinating , involving character study , but never does more than scratch the surface .
>2
the title not only describes its main characters , but the lazy people behind the camera as well .
>2
schaeffer has to find some hook on which to hang his persistently useless movies , and it might as well be the resuscitation of the middleaged character .
>2
another week , another grossout college comedy  ugh .
>2
a battle between bugeye theatre and deadeye matinee .
>2
the movie is virtually without context  journalistic or historical .
>2
what s worse is that pelosi knows it .
>2
... instead go rent  shakes the clown  , a much funnier film with a similar theme and an equally great robin williams performance .
>2
if the title is a jeopardy question , then the answer might be  how does steven seagal come across these days ? 
>2
or maybe  how will you feel after an 88minute ripoff of the rock with action confined to slomo gun firing and random glassshattering ? 
>2
the appeal of the vulgar , sexist , racist humour went over my head or  considering just how low brow it is  perhaps it snuck under my feet .
>2
the story really has no place to go since simone is not real  she ca nt provide any conflict .
>2
firsttime director joo pedro rodrigues  unwillingness to define his hero s background or motivations becomes more and more frustrating as the film goes on .
>2
 interview  loses its overall sense of mystery and becomes a tv episode rather than a documentary that you actually buy into .
>2
 unfaithful  cheats on itself and retreats to comfortable territory .
>2
thoughtless , random , superficial humour and a lot of very bad scouse accents
>2
plays like one of those conversations that comic book guy on  the simpsons  has .
>2
no thanks .
>2
wewannour money back , actually .
>2
should nt have been allowed to use the word  new  in its title , because there s not an original character , siuation or joke in the entire movie .
>2
often silly  and gross  but it s rarely as moronic as some campus grossout films .
>2
the advantage of a postapocalyptic setting is that it can be made on the cheap .
>2
any rock pile will do for a set .
>2
reign of fire has the disadvantage of also looking cheap .
>2
lucy s a dull girl , that s all .
>2
i admire it and yet can not recommend it , because it overstays its natural running time .
>2
it s a bad sign when you re rooting for the film to hurry up and get to its subjects  deaths just so the documentary will be over , but it s indicative of how uncompelling the movie is unless it happens to cover your particular area of interest .
>2
stephen earnhart s documentary is a decomposition of healthy eccentric inspiration and ambition  wearing a cloak of unsentimental , straightforward text  when it s really an exercise in gross romanticization of the delusional personality type .
>2
a semiautobiographical film that s so sloppily written and cast that you can not believe anyone more central to the creation of bugsy than the caterer had anything to do with it .
>2
the movie barely makes sense , with its unbelievable navet and arbitrary flashbacks .
>2
build some robots , haul em to the theatre with you for the late show , and put on your own mystery science theatre 3000 tribute to what is almost certainly going to go down as the worst  and only  killer website movie of this or any other year .
>2
... has about 34th the fun of its spry 2001 predecessor  but it s a rushed , slapdash , sequelforthesake  ofasequel with less than half the plot and ingenuity .
>2
it s tough to tell which is in more abundant supply in this woefully hackneyed movie , directed by scott kalvert , about street gangs and turf wars in 1958 brooklyn  stale cliches , gratuitous violence , or empty machismo .
>2
gooding and coburn are both oscar winners , a fact which , as you watch them clumsily mugging their way through snow dogs , seems inconceivable .
>2
at every opportunity to do something clever , the film goes right over the edge and kills every sense of believability ... all you have left is a nosurprise series of explosions and violence while banderas looks like he s not trying to laugh at how bad it
>2
... pitiful , slapdash disaster .
>2
a doa dud from frame one .
>2
jawdroppingly superficial , straining to get by on humor that is not even as daring as john ritter s glory days on three s company .
>1
there are plenty of scenes in frida that do work , but rarely do they involve the title character herself .
>2
although god is great addresses interesting matters of identity and heritage , it s hard to shake the feeling that it was intended to be a different kind of film .
>2
firsttimer john mckay is never able to pull it back on course .
>2
distances you by throwing out so many red herrings , so many false scares , that the genuine ones barely register .
>2
godard uses his characters  if that s not too glorified a term  as art things , mouthpieces , visual motifs , blanks .
>2
the movie generates plot points with a degree of randomness usually achieved only by lottery drawing .
>2
a predictable , manipulative stinker .
>2
the story passes time until it s time for an absurd finale of twisted metal , fireballs and revenge .
>1
it s a spectacular performance  ahem , we hope it s only acting .
>2
the movie suffers from two fatal ailments  a dearth of vitality and a story that s shapeless and uninflected .
>2
it s just weirdness for the sake of weirdness , and where human nature should be ingratiating , it s just grating .
>1
an ambitiously naturalistic , albeit halfbaked , drama about an abused , innercity autistic teen .
>1
no doubt the star and everyone else involved had their hearts in the right place .
>2
where their heads were is anyone s guess .
>2
call me a cynic , but there s something awfully deadly about any movie with a lifeaffirming message .
>2
a gratingly unfunny groaner littered with zerodimensional , unlikable characters and hackneyed , threadbare comic setups .
>1
got some good , organic character work , lots of obvious political insights and little room for engaging , imaginative filmmaking in its nearly 212  hour , dissipated length .
>2
a painfully slow clicheridden film filled with more holes than clyde barrow s car .
>2
like leafing through an album of photos accompanied by the sketchiest of captions .
>2
i guess it just goes to show that if you give a filmmaker an unlimited amount of phony blood , nothing good can happen .
>2
gaghan captures the halflit , sometimes creepy intimacy of college dorm rooms , a subtlety that makes the silly , overthetop coda especially disappointing .
>2
one of the most unpleasant things the studio has ever produced .
>2
will anyone who is nt a fangoria subscriber be excited that it has nt gone straight to video ?
>2
a selection of scenes in search of a movie .
>2
will undoubtedly play well in european markets , where mr. besson is a brand name , and in asia , where ms. shu is an institution , but american audiences will probably find it familiar and insufficiently cathartic .
>2
true to its animatronic roots  ... as stiff , ponderous and charmless as a mechanical apparatus ...  the country bears  should never have been brought out of hibernation .
>2
the script s judgment and sense of weight is way , way off .
>2
evelyn may be based on a true and historically significant story , but the filmmakers have made every effort to disguise it as an unimaginative screenwriter s invention .
>2
loosely speaking , we re in all of me territory again , and , strictly speaking , schneider is no steve martin .
>2
as aimless as an old pickup skidding completely out of control on a long patch of black ice , the movie makes two hours feel like four .
>2
limps along on a squirminducing fishoutofwater formula that goes nowhere and goes there very , very slowly .
>2
just the sort of lazy tearjerker that gives movies about ordinary folk a bad name .
>2
the redeeming feature of chan s films has always been the action , but the stunts in the tuxedo seem tired and , what s worse , routine .
>2
while the importance of being earnest offers opportunities for occasional smiles and chuckles , it does nt give us a reason to be in the theater beyond wilde s wit and the actors  performances .
>2
has all the scenic appeal of a cesspool .
>2
a rambling ensemble piece with loosely connected characters and plots that never quite gel .
>2
it s hard to say who might enjoy this , are there tolstoy groupies out there ?
>2
this is a movie that starts out like heathers , then becomes bring it on , then becomes unwatchable .
>2
the screenplay flounders under the weight of too many story lines .
>2
i think it was plato who said ,  i think , therefore i know better than to rush to the theatre for this one . 
>2
if damon and affleck attempt another project greenlight , next time out they might try paying less attention to the miniseries and more attention to the film it is about .
>2
this is rote drivel aimed at mom and dad s wallet .
>2
contrived , maudlin and clicheridden ... if this sappy script was the best the contest received , those rejected must have been astronomically bad .
>2
i hate the feeling of having been slimed in the name of high art .
>2
the kids in the audience at the preview screening seemed bored , cheering the pratfalls but little else  their parents , wise folks that they are , read books .
>2
whether jason x is this bad on purpose is never clear .
>2
but one thing s for sure  it never comes close to being either funny or scary .
>1
i like all four of the lead actors a lot and they manage to squeeze a few laughs out of the material , but they re treading water at best in this forgettable effort .
>2
is that it s a crime movie made by someone who obviously knows nothing about crime .
>2
this insufferable movie is meant to make you think about existential suffering .
>2
instead , it ll only put you to sleep .
>2
it s also not smart or barbed enough for older viewers  not everyone thinks poopoo jokes are  edgy . 
>2
a sleepinducingly slowpaced crime drama with clumsy dialogue , heavyhanded phoneyfeeling sentiment , and an overlyfamiliar set of plot devices .
>2
it s so tedious that it makes you forgive every fake , dishonest , entertaining and , ultimately , more perceptive moment in bridget jones s diary .
>2
almost as offensive as  freddy got fingered . 
>2
the gifted crudup has the perfect face to play a handsome blank yearning to find himself , and his cipherlike personality and bad behavior would play fine if the movie knew what to do with him .
>2
it is depressing , ruthlessly pained and depraved , the movie equivalent of staring into an open wound .
>2
ponderous , plodding soap opera disguised as a feature film .
>2
cold , pretentious , thoroughly dislikable study in sociopathy .
>2
for the future , one hopes mr. plympton will find room for one more member of his little band , a professional screenwriter .
>2
a cheap scam put together by some cynical creeps at revolution studios and imagine entertainment to make the suckers out there surrender  9 and 93 minutes of unrecoverable life .
>2
reign of fire never comes close to recovering from its demented premise , but it does sustain an enjoyable level of ridiculousness .
>1
human nature is a goofball movie , in the way that malkovich was , but it tries too hard .
>2
originality is sorely lacking .
>1
but while the highly predictable narrative falls short , treasure planet is truly gorgeous to behold .
>2
though there are entertaining and audacious moments , the movie s wildly careening tone and an extremely flat lead performance do little to salvage this filmmaker s flailing reputation .
>2
for a story set at sea , ghost ship is pretty landbound , with its leaden acting , dull exposition and telegraphed  surprises . 
>2
there might be some sort of credible genderprovoking philosophy submerged here , but who the hell cares ?
>2
nothing more than a stifling morality tale dressed up in peekaboo clothing .
>2
i like my christmas movies with more elves and snow and less pimps and ho s .
>2
it all seemed wasted like deniro s once promising career and the once grand long beach boardwalk .
>2
unfortunately , a cast of competent performers from movies , television and the theater are cast adrift in various new york city locations with no unifying rhythm or visual style .
>2
equilibrium the movie , as opposed to the manifesto , is really , really stupid .
>2
excruciatingly unfunny and pitifully unromantic .
>2
the film s thoroughly recycled plot and tiresome jokes ... drag the movie down .
>2
it does nt offer audiences any way of gripping what its point is , or even its attitude toward its subject .
>2
this kiddieoriented stinker is so bad that i even caught the gum stuck under my seat trying to sneak out of the theater
>2
though impostor deviously adopts the guise of a modern motion picture , it too is a bomb .
>2
cox offers plenty of glimpses at existing photos , but there are no movies of nijinsky , so instead the director treats us to an aimless hodgepodge .
>2
every note rings false .
>2
when the screenwriter responsible for one of the worst movies of one year directs an equally miserable film the following year , you d have a hard time believing it was just coincidence .
>2
it never rises to its clever whatif concept .
>2
this story of unrequited love does nt sustain interest beyond the first halfhour .
>2
this angstridden territory was covered earlier and much better in ordinary people .
>2
the entire film is one big excuse to play one lewd scene after another .
>2
about half of them are funny , a few are sexy and none are useful in telling the story , which is paperthin and decidedly unoriginal .
>2
a big , loud , bangthedrum bore .
>1
the concept behind kung pow  enter the fist is hilarious .
>2
el crimen del padre amaro would likely be most effective if used as a tool to rally anticatholic protestors .
>1
interesting and thoroughly unfaithful version of carmen
>1
a serious movie with serious ideas .
>2
but seriously , folks , it does nt work .
>2
there s nothing exactly wrong here , but there s not nearly enough that s right .
>2
the action here is unusually tame , the characters are too simplistic to maintain interest , and the plot offers few surprises .
>2
i could nt help but feel the wasted potential of this slapstick comedy .
>2
what madonna does here ca nt properly be called acting  more accurately , it s moving and it s talking and it s occasionally gesturing , sometimes all at once .
>2
even if you re an elvis person , you wo nt find anything to get excited about on this dvd .
>2
it s bedeviled by labored writing and slack direction .
>2
i m sure there s a teenage boy out there somewhere who s dying for this kind of entertainment .
>2
the tuxedo miscalculates badly by forcing the star to play second fiddle to the dull effects that allow the suit to come to life .
>2
the film is a confusing melange of tones and styles , one moment a romantic trifle and the next a turgid drama .
>2
there s a little violence and lots of sex in a bid to hold our attention , but it grows monotonous after a while , as do joan and philip s repetitive arguments , schemes and treachery .
>2
it drowns in sap .
>1
deliberately and devotedly constructed , far from heaven is too picture postcard perfect , too neat and new pinlike , too obviously a recreation to resonate .
>2
it s rare that a movie can be as intelligent as this one is in every regard except its storyline  everything that s good is ultimately scuttled by a plot that s just too boring and obvious .
>2
i m giving it thumbs down due to the endlessly repetitive scenes of embarrassment .
>2
there s got to be a more graceful way of portraying the devastation of this disease .
>2
the modernday characters are nowhere near as vivid as the 19thcentury ones .
>2
it s also built on a faulty premise , one it follows into melodrama and silliness .
>2
uneven performances and a spotty script add up to a biting satire that has no teeth .
>2
director jay russell stomps in hobnail boots over natalie babbitt s gentle , endearing 1975 children s novel .
>2
the troubling thing about clockstoppers is that it does nt make any sense .
>2
with its paint fights , motorized scooter chases and dewyeyed sentiment , it s a pretty listless collection of kidmovie clichs .
>2
kicks off with an inauspicious premise , mopes through a dreary tract of virtually plotless meanderings and then ends with a whimper .
>2
a rote exercise in both animation and storytelling .
>2
the material and the production itself are little more than routine .
>2
the movie s major and most devastating flaw is its reliance on formula , though , and it s quite enough to lessen the overall impact the movie could have had .
>2
not even steven spielberg has dreamed up such blatant and sickening product placement in a movie .
>2
it s all surface psychodramatics .
>2
the mothman prophecies , which is mostly a bore , seems to exist only for its climactic setpiece .
>2
kitschy , flashy , overlong soap opera .
>2
for all the time we spend with these people , we never really get inside of them .
>2
yet another arnold vehicle that fails to make adequate use of his particular talents .
>2
sandra bullock , despite downplaying her good looks , carries a little too much ai nt  shecute baggage into her lead role as a troubled and determined homicide cop to quite pull off the heavy stuff .
>2
an undistinguished attempt to make a classic theater piece cinematic .
>2
too many scenarios in which the hero might have an opportunity to triumphantly sermonize , and too few that allow us to wonder for ourselves if things will turn out okay .
>2
there is simply not enough of interest onscreen to sustain its seventyminute running time .
>2
broomfield s style of journalism is hardly journalism at all , and even those with an avid interest in the subject will grow impatient .
>2
has the disjointed feel of a bunch of strungtogether tv episodes .
>2
a series of escapades demonstrating the adage that what is good for the goose is also good for the gander , some of which occasionally amuses but none of which amounts to much of a story .
>2
ozpetek offers an aids subtext , skims over the realities of gay sex , and presents yet another tired old vision of the gay community as an allinclusive world where uptight , middle class bores like antonia can feel good about themselves .
>2
the sweetest thing is expressly for idiots who do nt care what kind of sewage they shovel into their mental gullets to simulate sustenance .
>2
sinks so low in a poorly played game of absurd plot twists , idiotic court maneuvers and stupid characters that even freeman ca nt save it .
>2
it made me realize that we really have nt had a good cheesy bmovie playing in theaters since ... well ... since last week s reign of fire .
>2
some movies were made for the big screen , some for the small screen , and some , like ballistic  ecks vs. sever , were made for the palm screen .
>2
sc2 is an autopilot hollywood concoction lacking in imagination and authentic christmas spirit , yet it s geared toward an audience full of masters of both .
>2
seems content to dogpaddle in the mediocre end of the pool , and it s a sad , sick sight .
>1
it s refreshing that someone understands the need for the bad boy  diesel , with his brawny frame and cool , composed delivery , fits the bill perfectly .
>2
suffers from a flat script and a low budget .
>1
there are deeply religious and spiritual people in this world who would argue that entering a church , synagogue or temple does nt mean you have to check your brain at the door .
>2
seemingly a vehicle to showcase the canadian s inane ramblings , stealing harvard is a smorgasbord of soliloquies about nothing delivered by the former mr. drew barrymore .
>2
this franchise has not spawned a single good film .
>2
the crap continues .
>1
high drama , disneystyle  a wing and a prayer and a hunky hasbeen pursuing his castle in the sky .
>2
like its script , which nurses plot holes gaping enough to pilot an entire olympic swim team through , the characters in swimfan seem motivated by nothing short of dull , braindeadening hangover .
>2
one big blustery movie where nothing really happens .
>2
when it comes out on video , then it s the perfect cure for insomnia .
>2
like a comedian who starts off promisingly but then proceeds to flop , comedian runs out of steam after a half hour .
>2
the pairing does sound promising in theory ... but their lack of chemistry makes eddie murphy and robert deniro in showtime look like old , familiar vaudeville partners .
>2
i could just feel the screenwriter at every moment  tap , tap , tap , tap , tapping away  on this screenplay .
>2
a stupid , derivative horror film that substitutes extreme gore for suspense .
>2
the rollerball sequences feel sanitised and stagey .
>2
roman polanski directs the pianist like a surgeon mends a broken heart  very meticulously but without any passion .
>2
this is an action movie with an action icon who s been all but decommissioned .
>2
even if it is generally amusing from time to time , i spy has all the same problems the majority of action comedies have .
>2
much like robin williams , death to smoochy has already reached its expiration date .
>2
an annoying orgy of excess and exploitation that has no point and goes nowhere .
>2
a tired , unnecessary retread ... a stale copy of a picture that was nt all that great to begin with .
>2
a worthy idea , but the uninspired scripts , acting and direction never rise above the level of an afterschool tv special .
>2
earsplitting exercise in formula crashandbash action .
>2
the emotional overload of female angst irreparably drags the film down .
>2
schaefer s ... determination to inject farcical raunch ... drowns out the promise of the romantic angle .
>2
like showgirls and glitter , the most entertaining moments here are unintentional .
>2
while some of the camera work is interesting , the film s midtolow budget is betrayed by the surprisingly shoddy makeup work .
>2
it s in the action scenes that things fall apart .
>2
impostor is a step down for director gary fleder .
>2
seagal , who looks more like danny aiello these days , mumbles his way through the movie .
>2
the movie is a negligible work of manipulation , an exploitation piece doing its usual worst to guilttrip parents .
>2
lacks dramatic punch and depth .
>2
i can analyze this movie in three words  thumbs friggin  down .
>2
sadly ,  garth  has nt progressed as nicely as  wayne . 
>2
make like the title and dodge this one .
>2
this is not one of the movies you d want to watch if you only had a week to live .
>2
the first hour is tedious though ford and neeson capably hold our interest , but its just not a thrilling movie .
>2
here s a case of two actors who do everything humanly possible to create characters who are sweet and believable , and are defeated by a screenplay that forces them into bizarre , implausible behavior .
>2
no amount of good acting is enough to save oleander s uninspired story .
>2
a vile , incoherent mess ... a scummy ripoff of david cronenberg s brilliant  videodrome . 
>2
murphy and wilson actually make a pretty good team ... but the project surrounding them is distressingly rote .
>2
think the lion king redone for horses , with fewer deliberate laughs , more inadvertent ones and stunningly trite songs by bryan adams , the world s most generic rock star .
>2
an amateurish , quasiimprovised acting exercise shot on ugly digital video .
>2
the holes in this film remain agape  holes punched through by an inconsistent , meandering , and sometimes dry plot .
>2
would benigni s italian pinocchio have been any easier to sit through than this hastily dubbed disaster ?
>2
officially , it is twice as bestial but half as funny .
>2
this is a fragmented film , once a good idea that was followed by the bad idea to turn it into a movie .
>1
mindless yet impressively lean spinoff of last summer s bloated effects fest the mummy returns .
>2
halfway through the movie , the humor dwindles .
>1
will be far more interesting to the soderbergh faithful than it will be to the casual moviegoer who might be lured in by julia roberts ...
>2
controlaltdelete simone as quickly as possible
>2
follows the original film virtually scene for scene and yet manages to bleed it almost completely dry of humor , verve and fun .
>2
has lost some of the dramatic conviction that underlies the best of comedies ...
>2
vaguely interesting , but it s just too too much .
>2
... no charm , no laughs , no fun , no reason to watch .
>2
a generic family comedy unlikely to be appreciated by anyone outside the under10 set .
>2
kung pow seems like some futile concoction that was developed hastily after oedekerk and his fellow moviemakers got through crashing a college keg party .
>2
kurys seems intimidated by both her subject matter and the period trappings of this debut venture into the heritage business .
>2
a manipulative feminist empowerment tale thinly posing as a serious drama about spousal abuse .
>1
everything in maid in manhattan is exceedingly pleasant , designed not to offend .
>1
it goes down easy , leaving virtually no aftertaste .
>2
a profoundly stupid affair , populating its hackneyed and meanspirited storyline with cardboard characters and performers who value cash above credibility .
>2
... pays tribute to heroes the way julia roberts hands out awards  with phony humility barely camouflaging grotesque narcissism .
>2
time stands still in more ways that one in clockstoppers , a scifi thriller as lazy as it is interminable .
>2
as a director , eastwood is off his game  there s no real sense of suspense , and none of the plot  surprises  are really surprising .
>2
a puzzle whose pieces do not fit .
>2
would that greengrass had gone a tad less for grit and a lot more for intelligibility .
>2
 butterfingered  is the word for the bigfisted direction of jez butterworth , who manages to blast even the smallest sensitivities from the romance with his clamorous approach .
>2
be forewarned , if you re depressed about anything before watching this film , you may just end up trying to drown yourself in a lake afterwards .
>2
a terrible adaptation of a play that only ever walked the delicate tightrope between farcical and loathsome .
>2
in the wrong hands , i.e. peploe s , it s simply unbearable
>2
an inexperienced director , mehta has much to learn .
>2
a limp eddie murphy vehicle that even he seems embarrassed to be part of .
>2
so muddled , repetitive and ragged that it says far less about the horrifying historical reality than about the filmmaker s characteristic style .
>2
a gushy episode of  m  a  s  h  only this time from an asian perspective .
>2
 looking for leonard  just seems to kinda sit in neutral , hoping for a stiff wind to blow it uphill or something .
>2
nothing more than four or five mild chuckles surrounded by 86 minutes of overlyfamiliar and poorlyconstructed comedy .
>1
definitely in the guilty pleasure bmovie category , reign of fire is so incredibly inane that it is laughingly enjoyable .
>2
goodlooking but relentlessly lowbrow outing plays like clueless does south fork .
>2
entertaining enough , but nothing new
>2
... one resurrection too many .
>2
this is a film about the irksome , tiresome nature of complacency that remains utterly satisfied to remain the same throughout .
>2
even as the hero of the story rediscovers his passion in life , the mood remains oddly detached .
>2
in spite of featuring a script credited to no fewer than five writers , apparently nobody here bothered to check it twice .
>2
no one involved , save dash , shows the slightest aptitude for acting , and the script , credited to director abdul malik abbott and ernest  tron  anderson , seems entirely improvised .
>1
initially gripping , eventually cloying pow drama .
>2
a timid , soggy near miss .
>2
works better in the conception than it does in the execution ... winds up seeming just a little too clever .
>2
to the vast majority of more casual filmgoers , it will probably be a talky bore .
>2
shunji iwai s all about lily chou chou is a beautifully shot , but ultimately flawed film about growing up in japan .
>2
with more character development this might have been an eerie thriller  with better payoffs , it could have been a thinking man s monster movie .
>2
there s not a single jumpinyourseat moment and believe it or not , jason actually takes a backseat in his own film to special effects .
>1
goldbacher draws on an elegant visual sense and a talent for easy , seductive pacing ... but she and writing partner laurence coriat do nt manage an equally assured narrative coinage .
>2
though harris is affecting at times , he can not overcome the sense that pumpkin is a mere plot pawn for two directors with far less endearing disabilities .
>2
the documentary is much too conventional  lots of boring talking heads , etc.  to do the subject matter justice .
>2
the movie itself appears to be running on hypertime in reverse as the truly funny bits get further and further apart .
>2
this is not a jackie chan movie .
>2
it s just a movie that happens to have jackie chan in it .
>1
and that makes all the difference .
>2
far too clever by half , howard s film is really a series of strungtogether moments , with all the spaces in between filled with fantasies , daydreams , memories and one fantastic visual trope after another .
>2
the problem with movies about angels is they have a tendency to slip into hokum .
>2
a rumor of angels does nt just slip  it avalanches into forced fuzziness .
>2
no big whoop , nothing new to see , zero thrills , too many flashbacks and a choppy ending make for a bad film .
>2
i do nt think this movie loves women at all .
>2
shankman ... and screenwriter karen janszen bungle their way through the narrative as if it were a series of bible parables and not an actual story .
>2
a negligible british comedy .
>2
fails to convince the audience that these brats will ever be anything more than losers .
>2
slack and uninspired , and peopled mainly by characters so unsympathetic that you re left with a sour taste in your mouth .
>2
skip this turd and pick your nose instead because you re sure to get more out of the latter experience .
>2
trailer trash cinema so uncool the only thing missing is the  gadzooks ! 
>2
her film is like a beautiful food entre that is nt heated properly , so that it ends up a bit cold and relatively flavorless .
>2
like the world of his film , hartley created a monster but did nt know how to handle it .
>2
no new plot conceptions or environmental changes , just different bodies for sharp objects to rip through .
>2
needs more impressionistic cinematography and exhilarating pointofview shots and fewer slowmotion  grandeur  shots and quickcut edits that often detract from the athleticism .
>2
in the end , there is nt much to it .
>2
a waste of fearless purity in the acting craft .
>2
the film is ultimately about as inspiring as a hallmark card .
>2
anyone not into hightech splatterfests is advised to take the warning literally , and log on to something more userfriendly .
>2
disreputable doings and exquisite trappings are dampened by a lackluster script and substandard performances .
>2
you could easily mistake it for a sketchy workinprogress that was inexplicably rushed to the megaplexes before its time .
>2
yet another entry in the sentimental ohthosewackybrits genre that was ushered in by the full monty and is still straining to produce another smash hit .
>2
for those for whom the name woody allen was once a guarantee of something fresh , sometimes funny , and usually genuinely worthwhile , hollywood ending is a depressing experience
>2
femme fatale offers nothing more than a baitandswitch that is beyond playing fair with the audience .
>2
are we dealing with dreams , visions or being told what actually happened as if it were the third ending of clue ?
>2
it could have been something special , but two things drag it down to mediocrity  director clare peploe s misunderstanding of marivaux s rhythms , and mira sorvino s limitations as a classical actress .
>2
fluffy neonoir hiding behind cutesy film references .
>2
imagine susan sontag falling in love with howard stern .
>2
should have been worth cheering as a breakthrough but is devoid of wit and humor .
>1
the best thing about the movie is its personable , amusing cast .
>2
these guys seem great to knock back a beer with but they re simply not funny performers .
>2
everything was as superficial as the forced new jersey lowbrow accent uma had .
>2
director david fincher and writer david koepp ca nt sustain it .
>2
one of the most highlypraised disappointments i ve had the misfortune to watch in quite some time .
>2
director shekhar kapur and screenwriters michael schiffer and hossein amini have tried hard to modernize and reconceptualize things , but the barriers finally prove to be too great .
>2
strong filmmaking requires a clear sense of purpose , and in that ohsoimportant category , the four feathers comes up short .
>2
devolves into the derivative , leaning on badlyrendered cgi effects .
>2
a grand fart coming from a director beginning to resemble someone s crazy french grandfather .
>2
the script is a disaster , with cloying messages and irksome characters .
>2
hollywood has taken quite a nosedive from alfred hitchcock s imaginative flight to shyamalan s selfimportant summer fluff .
>2
the film s maudlin focus on the young woman s infirmity and her naive dreams play like the worst kind of hollywood heartstring plucking .
>1
i firmly believe that a good video game movie is going to show up soon .
>2
i also believe that resident evil is not it .
>2
it has the air of a surprisingly juvenile lark , a popinfluenced prank whose charms are immediately apparent and wear thin with repetition .
>2
this is cruel , misanthropic stuff with only weak claims to surrealism and black comedy .
>2
no amount of nostalgia for carvey s glory days can disguise the fact that the new film is a lame kiddie flick and that carvey s considerable talents are wasted in it .
>2
lazily directed by charles stone iii ... from a leaden script by matthew cirulnick and novelist thulani davis .
>2
though jones and snipes are enthralling , the movie bogs down in rhetoric and clich .
>2
an artsploitation movie with too much exploitation and too little art .
>2
the pacing is often way off and there are too many bona fide groaners among too few laughs .
>2
barely manages for but a few seconds over its seemingly eternal running time to pique your interest , your imagination , your empathy or anything , really , save your disgust and your indifference .
>2
one senses in world traveler and in his earlier film that freundlich bears a grievous but obscure complaint against fathers , and circles it obsessively , without making contact .
>1
in between the icy stunts , the actors spout hilarious dialogue about following your dream and  just letting the mountain tell you what to do . 
>2
is a mess .
>2
hypnotically dull , relentlessly downbeat , laughably predictable wail pitched to the cadence of a depressed fifteenyearold s suicidal poetry .
>1
the concept is a hoot .
>1
the trailer is a riot .
>2
the movie is a dud .
>1
it s a boring movie about a boring man , made watchable by a bravura performance from a consummate actor incapable of being boring .
>2
because the intelligence level of the characters must be low , very low , very very low , for the masquerade to work , the movie contains no wit , only labored gags .
>2
it s hard to imagine another director ever making his wife look so bad in a major movie .
>2
these characters become wearisome .
>2
a hit  andmiss affair , consistently amusing but not as outrageous or funny as cho may have intended or as imaginative as one might have hoped .
>2
after sitting through this sloppy , madeformovie comedy special , it makes me wonder if lawrence hates criticism so much that he refuses to evaluate his own work .
>2
contrived pastiche of caper clichs .
>2
despite its sincere acting , signs is just another unoriginal run of the mill scifi film with a flimsy ending and lots of hype .
>2
loud , chaotic and largely unfunny .
>2
qualities that were once amusing are becoming irritating .
>2
donovan ... squanders his main asset , jackie chan , and fumbles the vital action sequences .
>2
there is no psychology here , and no real narrative logic  just a series of carefully choreographed atrocities , which become strangely impersonal and abstract .
>2
bread , my sweet has so many flaws it would be easy for critics to shred it .
>2
leaks treacle from every pore .
>2
the characters are so generic and the plot so bland that even as rogue cia assassins working for chris cooper s agency boss close in on the resourceful amnesiac , we do nt feel much for damonbourne or his predicament .
>2
kapur weighs down the tale with bogus profundities .
>2
blue crush is as predictable as the tides .
>2
... the movie feels stitched together from stock situations and characters from other movies .
>2
if you enjoy being rewarded by a script that assumes you are nt very bright , then blood work is for you .
>2
trouble every day is a success in some sense , but it s hard to like a film so cold and dead .
>2
a wellintentioned effort that s still too burdened by the actor s offbeat sensibilities for the earnest emotional core to emerge with any degree of accessibility .
>2
any reasonably creative eighthgrader could have written a more credible script , though with the same number of continuity errors .
>2
... while the humor aspects of  jason x  were far more entertaining than i had expected , everything else about the film tanks .
>2
like an afterschool special with costumes by gianni versace , mad love looks better than it feels .
>2
the script , the gags , the characters are all directtovideo stuff , and that s where this film should have remained .
>2
a thriller without thrills and a mystery devoid of urgent questions .
>2
a collage of clichs and a dim echo of allusions to other films .
>2
the film is hampered by its predictable plot and paperthin supporting characters .
>2
an excruciating demonstration of the unsalvageability of a movie saddled with an amateurish screenplay .
>2
how many more times will indie filmmakers subject us to boring , selfimportant stories of how horrible we are to ourselves and each other ?
>2
there are some laughs in this movie , but williams  anarchy gets tiresome , the satire is weak .
>2
as steamy as last week s pork dumplings .
>2
the somber pacing and lack of dramatic fireworks make green dragon seem more like medicine than entertainment .
>2
the filmmakers needed more emphasis on the storytelling and less on the glamorous machine that thrusts the audience into a future they wo nt much care about .
>2
another wholly unnecessary addition to the growing , moldering pile of , well , extreme stunt pictures .
>2
this strenuously unfunny showtime deserves the hook .
>2
the whole thing s fairly lame , making it par for the course for disney sequels .
>2
... its solemn pretension prevents us from sharing the awe in which it holds itself .
>2
if disney s cinderella proved that  a dream is a wish your heart makes ,  then cinderella ii proves that a nightmare is a wish a studio s wallet makes .
>2
features nonsensical and laughable plotting , wooden performances , ineptly directed action sequences and some of the worst dialogue in recent memory .
>2
nothing about this movie works .
>2
a spooky yarn of demonic doings on the high seas that works better the less the brain is engaged .
>2
none of birthday girl s calculated events take us by surprise ...
>2
lisa rinzler s cinematography may be lovely , but love liza s tale itself virtually collapses into an inhalant blackout , maintaining consciousness just long enough to achieve callow pretension .
>2
the narrator and the other characters try to convince us that acting transfigures esther , but she s never seen speaking on stage  one feels cheated , and esther seems to remain an unchanged dullard .
>2
it s exactly the kind of movie toback s detractors always accuse him of making .
>2
with the dog days of august upon us , think of this dog of a movie as the cinematic equivalent of high humidity .
>2
the film is like sitting in a downtown caf , overhearing a bunch of typical latetwentysomethings natter on about nothing , and desperately wishing you could change tables .
>2
this rather unfocused , alloverthemap movie would be a lot better if it pared down its plots and characters to a few rather than dozens ... or if it were subtler ... or if it had a sense of humor .
>2
not only does the thoroughly formulaic film represent totally exemplify middleoftheroad mainstream , it also represents glossy hollywood at its laziest .
>2
a shame that stealing harvard is too busy getting in its own way to be anything but frustrating , boring , and forgettable .
>2
nearly every attempt at humor here is doa .
>2
collapses under its own meager weight .
>2
technically and artistically inept .
>2
those who are only mildly curious , i fear , will be put to sleep or bewildered by the artsy and often pointless visuals .
>2
though tom shadyac s film kicks off spookily enough , around the halfway mark it takes an abrupt turn into glucose sentimentality and laughable contrivance .
>2
a long , dull procession of despair , set to cello music culled from a minimalist funeral .
>2
call me a coldhearted curmudgeon for not being able to enjoy a mindless action movie , but i believe a movie can be mindless without being the peak of all things insipid .
>2
death might be a release .
>2
no , even that s too committed .
>2
sodden and glum , even in those moments where it s supposed to feel funny and light .
>2
priggish , lethargically paced parable of renewal .
>2
a beautifully shot but dull and ankledeep  epic . 
>2
even with its  50million us budget , pinocchio never quite achieves the feel of a fanciful motion picture .
>2
this is a thirdperson story now , told by hollywood , and much more ordinary for it .
>1
the filmmakers know how to please the eye , but it is not always the prettiest pictures that tell the best story .
>2
written , flatly , by david kendall and directed , barely , by there s something about mary cowriter ed decter .
>2
you leave the same way you came  a few tasty morsels under your belt , but no new friends .
>2
it s depressing to see how far herzog has fallen .
>2
but rather ,  how can you charge money for this ? 
>2
millions of dollars heaped upon a project of such vast proportions need to reap more rewards than spiffy bluescreen technique and stylish weaponry .
>2
 freaky friday ,  it s not .
>2
perhaps a better celebration of these unfairly dismissed heroes would be a film that is nt this painfully forced , false and fabricated .
>2
although no pastry is violated , this nasty comedy pokes fun at the same easy targets as other rowdy raunchfests  farts , boobs , unmentionables  without much success .
>2
maybe you ll be lucky , and there ll be a power outage during your screening so you can get your money back .
>2
the characterizations and dialogue lack depth or complexity , with the ironic exception of scooter .
>2
for the rest of us , sitting through dahmer s two hours amounts to little more than punishment .
>2
somewhere inside the mess that is world traveler , there is a mediocre movie trying to get out .
>2
an artful yet depressing film that makes a melodramatic mountain out of the molehill of a missing bike .
>2
the movie s ultimate point  that everyone should be themselves  is trite , but the screenwriter and director michel gondry restate it to the point of ridiculousness .
>2
... expands the horizons of boredom to the point of collapse , turning into a black hole of dullness , from which no interesting concept can escape .
>2
sad nonsense , this .
>1
but not without cheesy fun factor .
>2
one of those decadesspanning historical epics that strives to be intimate and socially encompassing but fails to do justice to either effort in three hours of screen time .
>2
the movie wavers between hallmark card sentimentality and goofy , lifeaffirming moments straight out of a cellular phone commercial .
>2
the director s many dodges and turns add up to little more than a screenful of gamesmanship that s low on both suspense and payoff .
>2
the satire is unfocused , while the story goes nowhere .
>2
they threw loads of money at an idea that should ve been so much more even if it was only made for teenage boys and wrestling fans .
>2
reyes  directorial debut has good things to offer , but ultimately it s undone by a sloppy script
>2
if you re over 25 , have an iq over 90 , and have a driver s license , you should be able to find better entertainment .
>2
the darker elements of misogyny and unprovoked violence suffocate the illumination created by the two daughters and the sparse instances of humor meant to shine through the gloomy film noir veil .
>2
never does  lilo  stitch  reach the emotion or timelessness of disney s great past , or even that of more recent successes such as  mulan  or  tarzan . 
>2
one of those soso films that could have been much better .
>2
crossroads feels like a teenybopper ed wood film , replete with the pubescent scandalous innuendo and the highstrung but flaccid drama .
>2
fails to satisfactorily exploit its gender politics , genre thrills or inherent humor .
>2
cacoyannis  vision is far less mature , interpreting the play as a call for pity and sympathy for anachronistic phantasms haunting the imagined glory of their own pasts .
>2
it has more in common with a fireworks display than a movie , which normally is expected to have characters and a storyline .
>2
it appears to have been made by people to whom the idea of narrative logic or cohesion is an entirely foreign concept .
>2
it s not helpful to listen to extremist namecalling , regardless of whether you think kissinger was a calculating fiend or just a slippery selfpromoter .
>2
abandon spends 90 minutes trying figure out whether or not some cocky pseudointellectual kid has intentionally left college or was killed .
>2
the only problem is that , by the end , no one in the audience or the film seems to really care .
>1
no such thing is sort of a minimalist beauty and the beast , but in this case the beast should definitely get top billing .
>1
robert john burke as the monster horns in and steals the show .
>2
due to stodgy , soap operaish dialogue , the rest of the cast comes across as stick figures reading lines from a teleprompter .
>1
while it may not add up to the sum of its parts , holofcener s film offers just enough insight to keep it from being simpleminded , and the ensemble cast is engaging enough to keep you from shifting in your chair too often .
>2
nobody seems to have cared much about any aspect of it , from its cheesy screenplay to the grayish quality of its lighting to its lastminute , haphazard theatrical release .
>2
a thoroughly awful movie  dumb , narratively chaotic , visually sloppy ... a weird amalgam of  the thing  and a geriatric  scream . 
>2
... another example of how sandler is losing his touch .
>2
nothing sticks , really , except a lingering creepiness one feels from being dragged through a sad , sordid universe of guns , drugs , avarice and damaged dreams .
>2
what goes on for the 110 minutes of  panic room  is a battle of witlessness between a notsobright mother and daughter and an even less capable trio of criminals .
>2
the plot s contrivances are uncomfortably strained .
>2
guilty of the worst sin of attributable to a movie like this  it s not scary in the slightest .
>2
schnieder bounces around with limp wrists , wearing tight tummy tops and hip huggers , twirling his hair on his finger and assuming that s enough to sustain laughs ...
>2
by the final whistle you re convinced that this mean machine was a decent tv outing that just does nt have big screen magic .
>2
to say that this vapid vehicle is downright doltish and uneventful is just as obvious as telling a country skunk that he has severe body odor .
>2
a film of empty , fetishistic violence in which murder is casual and fun .
>2
pretend it s a werewolf itself by avoiding eye contact and walking slowly away .
>1
it s fun , but it s a real howler .
>2
some fine acting , but ultimately a movie with no reason for being .
>2
it s difficult to feel anything much while watching this movie , beyond mild disturbance or detached pleasure at the acting .
>2
a waterlogged version of  fatal attraction  for the teenybopper set ... a sad , soggy potboiler that wastes the talents of its attractive young leads .
>2
sweet gentle jesus , did the screenwriters just do a cutandpaste of every bad actionmovie line in history ?
>2
this is for the most part a useless movie , even with a great director at the helm .
>2
a loud , witless mess that has none of the charm and little of the intrigue from the tv series .
>2
even on its own ludicrous terms , the sum of all fears generates little narrative momentum , and invites unflattering comparisons to other installments in the ryan series .
>2
as predictable as the outcome of a globetrottersgenerals game , juwanna mann is even more ludicrous than you d expect from the guyinadress genre , and a personal low for everyone involved .
>2
where tom green stages his gags as assaults on america s kneejerk moral sanctimony , jackass lacks aspirations of social upheaval .
>2
the april 2002 instalment of the american war for independence , complete with loads of cgi and bushels of violence , but not a drop of human blood .
>2
contains all the substance of a twinkie  easy to swallow , but scarcely nourishing .
>2
return to neverland manages to straddle the line between another classic for the company and just another runofthemill disney sequel intended for the home video market .
>2
rarely does a film so graceless and devoid of merit as this one come along .
>2
it s a thin notion , repetitively stretched out to feature length , awash in selfconsciously flashy camera effects , droning house music and flat , flat dialogue .
>2
the colorful masseur wastes its time on mood rather than riding with the inherent absurdity of ganesh s rise up the social ladder .
>2
... an incredibly heavyhanded , manipulative dud that feels all too familiar .
>2
wimps out by going for that pg13 rating , so the more graphic violence is mostly offscreen and the sexuality is muted .
>1
trapped presents a frightening and compelling  what if ? 
>2
madonna has made herself over so often now , there s apparently nothing left to work with , sort of like michael jackson s nose .
>2
never having seen the first two films in the series , i ca nt compare friday after next to them , but nothing would change the fact that what we have here is a load of clams left in the broiling sun for a good three days .
>2
the story is lacking any real emotional impact , and the plot is both contrived and cliched .
>2
a depraved , incoherent , instantly disposable piece of hackery .
>2
it s a bad action movie because there s no rooting interest and the spectacle is grotesque and boring .
>2
so aggressively cheery that pollyana would reach for a barf bag .
>2
scoobydoo does nt know if it wants to be a retrorefitting exercise in campy recall for older fans or a silly , nickelodeonesque kiddie flick .
>2
russell lacks the visual panache , the comic touch , and perhaps the budget of sommers s titlebout features .
>2
highly uneven and inconsistent ... margarita happy hour kinda resembles the el cheapo margaritas served within .
>2
very stupid and annoying .
>2
the sum of all fears pretends to be a serious exploration of nuclear terrorism , but it s really nothing more than warmedover cold war paranoia .
>2
a listless and desultory affair .
>2
represents the depths to which the girlsbehavingbadly film has fallen .
>2
how inept is serving sara ?
>2
it makes even elizabeth hurley seem graceless and ugly .
>2
helmer hudlin tries to make a hip comedy , but his dependence on slapstick defeats the possibility of creating a more darkly edged tome .
>2
lazy , miserable and smug .
>2
this is one of the biggest disappointments of the year .
>2
every visual joke is milked , every setup obvious and lengthy , every punchline predictable .
>2
there s no energy .
>2
this is a poster movie , a mediocre tribute to films like them !
>2
at three hours and with very little story or character development , there is plenty of room for editing , and a much shorter cut surely would have resulted in a smoother , more focused narrative without sacrificing any of the cultural intrigue .
>2
this is the kind of movie that you only need to watch for about thirty seconds before you say to yourself ,  ah , yes , here we have a bad , bad , bad movie . 
>2
there s too much forced drama in this wildly uneven movie , about a young man s battle with his inescapable past and uncertain future in a very shapable but largely unfulfilling present .
>1
it s at once laughable and compulsively watchable , in its committed dumbness .
>2
all the sensuality , all the eroticism of a good vampire tale has been , pardon the pun , sucked out and replaced by goth goofiness .
>2
a cross between blow and boyz n the hood , this movie strives to be more , but does nt quite get there .
>1
good performances keep it from being a total rehash .
>2
the screenplay is hugely overwritten , with tons and tons of dialogue  most of it given to children .
>1
at times , the movie looks genuinely pretty .
>2
not even felinni would know what to make of this italian freakshow .
>2
it s difficult to conceive of anyone who has reached puberty actually finding the characters in slackers or their antics amusing , let alone funny .
>2
despite its promising cast of characters , big trouble remains a loosely tied series of vignettes which only prove that  zany  does nt necessarily mean  funny . 
>2
both shrill and soporific , and because everything is repeated five or six times , it can seem tiresomely simpleminded .
>2
does not go far enough in its humor or stock ideas to stand out as particularly memorable or even all that funny .
>2
neither revelatory nor truly edgy  merely crassly flamboyant and comedically labored .
>2
just about everyone involved here seems to be coasting .
>2
fails so fundamentally on every conventional level that it achieves some kind of goofy grandeur .
>2
there s a persistent theatrical sentiment and a woozy quality to the manner of the storytelling , which undercuts the devastatingly telling impact of utter loss personified in the film s simple title .
>2
while howard s appreciation of brown and his writing is clearly wellmeaning and sincere , the movie would be impossible to sit through were it not for the supporting cast .
>2
a preposterous , prurient whodunit .
>2
go , girls , right down the reality drain .
>2
boasting some of the most poorly staged and lit action in memory , impostor is as close as you can get to an imitation movie .
>2
can be classified as one of those  alternate reality  movies ... except that it would have worked so much better dealing in only one reality .
>1
predictable and cloying , though brown sugar is so earnest in its yearning for the days before rap went nihilistic that it summons more spirit and bite than your average formulaic romantic quadrangle .
>2
... unlikable , uninteresting , unfunny , and completely , utterly inept .
>2
the film is so busy making reference to other films and trying to be other films that it fails to have a heart , mind or humor of its own .
>2
an imponderably stilted and selfconsciously arty movie .
>2
muddled , melodramatic paranormal romance is an alltime low for kevin costner .
>2
too clumsy in key moments ... to make a big splash .
>2
just a bunch of good actors flailing around in a caper that s neither original nor terribly funny .
>2
 matrix   style massacres erupt throughout ... but the movie has a tougher time balancing its violence with kafkainspired philosophy .
>1
at least it s a fairly impressive debut from the director , charles stone iii .
>2
it all unfolds predictably , and the adventures that happen along the way seem repetitive and designed to fill time , providing no real sense of suspense .
>2
run for your lives !
>2
why would anyone cast the magnificent jackie chan in a movie full of stunt doubles and special effects ?
>2
a grating , emaciated flick .
>2
unambitious writing emerges in the movie , using a plot that could have come from an animatedmovie screenwriting textbook .
>2
we have poignancy jostling against farce , thoughtful dialogue elbowed aside by oneliners , and a visual style that incorporates rotoscope animation for no apparent reason except , maybe , that it looks neat .
>1
according to the script , grant and bullock s characters are made for each other .
>2
ararat feels like a book report
>2
steve oedekerk is , alas , no woody allen .
>2
a lot like the imaginary sport it projects onto the screen  loud , violent and mindless .
>2
the acting is amateurish , the cinematography is atrocious , the direction is clumsy , the writing is insipid and the violence is at once luridly graphic and laughably unconvincing .
>2
shows that jackie chan is getting older , and that s something i would rather live in denial about
>2
with miscast leads , banal dialogue and an absurdly overblown climax , killing me softly belongs firmly in the sobadit s  good camp .
>2
the slapstick is labored , and the bigger setpieces flat .
>2
this is the kind of movie where people who have never picked a lock do so easily after a few tries and become expert fighters after a few weeks .
>2
the problem with the mayhem in formula 51 is not that it s offensive , but that it s boring .
>2
much of the digitally altered footage appears jagged , as if filmed directly from a television monitor , while the extensive use of stock footage quickly becomes a tiresome clich .
>2
the film never rises above a conventional , two dimension tale
>2
told in scattered fashion , the movie only intermittently lives up to the stories and faces and music of the men who are its subject .
>1
the irony is that this film s cast is uniformly superb  their performances could have  should have  been allowed to stand on their own .
>1
if ever a concept came handed down from the movie gods on a silver platter , this is it .
>2
if ever such a dependable concept was botched in execution , this is it .
>2
a feelgood movie that does nt give you enough to feel good about .
>1
adolescents will be adequately served by the movie s sophomoric blend of shenanigans and slapstick , although the more lasciviousminded might be disappointed in the relative modesty of a movie that sports a  topless tutorial service . 
>2
this mistakenidentity picture is so filmculture referential that the final product is a ghost .
>2
the picture emerges as a surprisingly anemic disappointment .
>2
you ll cry for your money back .
>2
slap me , i saw this movie .
>2
behind the glitz , hollywood is sordid and disgusting .
>2
scherfig , who has had a successful career in tv , tackles more than she can handle .
>2
just consider what new best friend does not have , beginning with the minor omission of a screenplay .
>2
oscar caliber cast does nt live up to material
>2
they just have problems , which are neither original nor are presented in convincing way .
>2
carrying this waferthin movie on his nimble shoulders , chan wades through putrid writing , direction and timing with a smile that says ,  if i stay positive , maybe i can channel one of my greatest pictures , drunken master . 
>2
so putrid it is not worth the price of the match that should be used to burn every print of the film .
>2
in the end , the movie bogs down in insignificance , saying nothing about kennedy s assassination and revealing nothing about the pathology it pretends to investigate .
>2
starts out ballsy and stylish but fails to keep it up and settles into clichs .
>2
sometimes makes less sense than the bruckheimeresque american action flicks it emulates .
>2
one of those films where the characters inhabit that special annex of hell where adults behave like kids , children behave like adults and everyone screams at the top of their lungs no matter what the situation .
>2
there s only one way to kill michael myers for good  stop buying tickets to these movies .
>2
the movie is about as humorous as watching your favorite pet get buried alive .
>2
in other words , about as bad a film you re likely to see all year .
>2
five screenwriters are credited with the clichladen screenplay  it seems as if each watered down the version of the one before .
>2
the whole thing comes off like a particularly amateurish episode of bewitched that takes place during spring break .
>2
well made but uninvolving , bloodwork is nt a terrible movie , just a stultifyingly obvious one  an unrewarding collar for a murder mystery .
>2
so we got ten little indians meets friday the 13th by way of clean and sober , filmed on the set of carpenter s the thing and loaded with actors you re most likely to find on the next inevitable incarnation of the love boat .
>2
the movie s blatant derivativeness is one reason it s so lackluster .
>2
kids do nt mind crappy movies as much as adults , provided there s lots of cute animals and clumsy people .
>2
it s the humanizing stuff that will probably sink the film for anyone who does nt think about percentages all day long .
>1
ken russell would love this .
>2
in one scene , we get a stab at soccer hooliganism , a doublebarreled ripoff of quentin tarantino s climactic shootout  and meat loaf explodes .
>2
this is absolutely and completely ridiculous and an insult to every family whose mother has suffered through the horrible pains of a death by cancer .
>2
the premise of  abandon  holds promise , ... but its delivery is a complete mess .
>2
a little too ponderous to work as shallow entertainment , not remotely incisive enough to qualify as drama , monsoon wedding serves mostly to whet one s appetite for the bollywood films .
>2
unless bob crane is someone of particular interest to you , this film s impressive performances and adept direction are nt likely to leave a lasting impression .
>1
the bottom line with nemesis is the same as it has been with all the films in the series  fans will undoubtedly enjoy it , and the uncommitted need nt waste their time on it .
>2
the lousy john q all but spits out denzel washington s fine performance in the title role .
>2
the whole thing feels like a ruse , a tactic to cover up the fact that the picture is constructed around a core of flimsy  or , worse yet , nonexistent  ideas .
>2
what a stiflingly unfunny and unoriginal mess this is !
>2
the film is so packed with subplots involving the various silbersteins that it feels more like the pilot episode of a tv series than a feature film .
>2
opera on film is never satisfactory .
>1
the art demands live viewing .
>2
the innate theatrics that provide its thrills and extreme emotions lose their luster when flattened onscreen .
>2
despite all the closeddoor hankypanky , the film is essentially juiceless .
>2
it is parochial , accessible to a chosen few , standoffish to everyone else , and smugly suggests a superior moral tone is more important than filmmaking skill
>2
the sweetest thing leaves an awful sour taste .
>2
it s lost the politics and the social observation and become just another situation romance about a couple of saps stuck in an inarticulate screenplay .
>2
terminally bland , painfully slow and needlessly confusing ... the movie , shot on digital videotape rather than film , is frequently indecipherable .
>1
as dumb and cheesy as they may be , the cartoons look almost shakespearean  both in depth and breadth  after watching this digitaleffectsheavy , supposed familyfriendly comedy .
>2
aloof and lacks any real raw emotion , which is fatal for a film that relies on personal relationships .
>2
a lowrent retread of the alien pictures .
>2
its initial excitement settles into a warmed over pastiche .
>2
a big meal of cliches that the talented cast generally chokes on .
>2
the story has little wit and no surprises .
>2
the merchantivory team continues to systematically destroy everything we hold dear about cinema , only now it s begun to split up so that it can do even more damage .
>2
what should have been a cutting hollywood satire is instead about as fresh as last week s issue of variety .
>2
hey everybody , wanna watch a movie in which a guy dressed as a children s party clown gets violently gangraped ?
>2
a little more intensity and a little less charm would have saved this film a world of hurt .
>2
the movie s plot is almost entirely witless and inane , carrying every gag two or three times beyond its limit to sustain a laugh .
>2
... may work as an addictive guilty pleasure but the material never overcomes its questionable satirical ambivalence .
>2
as in aimless , arduous , and arbitrary .
>2
plays like a glossy melodrama that occasionally verges on camp .
>2
a puppy dog so desperate for attention it nearly breaks its little neck trying to perform entertaining tricks .
>2
just about all of the film is confusing on one level or another , making ararat far more demanding than it needs to be .
>2
a little less extreme than in the past , with longer exposition sequences between them , and with fewer gags to break the tedium .
>2
there s a heavy stench of  been there , done that  hanging over the film .
>2
the biggest problem with satin rouge is lilia herself .
>1
a quaint , romanticized rendering .
>2
a potentially good comic premise and excellent cast are terribly wasted .
>2
woody allen used to ridicule movies like hollywood ending .
>2
been there done that .
>2
there is only so much baked cardboard i need to chew .
>2
a movie like the guys is why film criticism can be considered work .
>2
even if it made its original release date last fall , it would ve reeked of a beenthere , donethat sameness .
>2
a loud , ugly , irritating movie without any of its satirical salvos hitting a discernible target .
>2
a movie version of a paintbynumbers picture .
>2
we can tell what it is supposed to be , but ca nt really call it a work of art .
>1
bravado kathy !
>2
... liotta is put in an impossible spot because his character s deceptions ultimately undo him and the believability of the entire scenario .
>2
unfunny and lacking any sense of commitment to or affection for its characters , the reginald hudlin comedy relies on toilet humor , ethnic slurs .
>2
this romanticcomedy asks the question how much souvlaki can you take before indigestion sets in .
>2
squandering his opportunity to make absurdist observations , burns gets caught up in the rush of slapstick thoroughfare .
>2
it has no affect on the kurds , but it wore me down .
>2
the actors improvise and scream their way around this movie directionless , lacking any of the rollicking dark humor so necessary to make this kind of idea work on screen .
>2
cowriterdirector jonathan parker s attempts to fashion a brazillike , hyperreal satire fall dreadfully short .
>2
a superfluous sequel ... plagued by that old familiar feeling of  let s get this thing over with   everyone has shown up at the appointed time and place , but visible enthusiasm is mighty hard to find .
>2
if there s a heaven for bad movies , deuces wild is on its way .
>2
comes off like a bad imitation of the bard .
>2
what s missing in murder by numbers is any real psychological grounding for the teens  deviant behaviour .
>2
an uninspired preachy and clichd war film .
>2
horrendously amateurish filmmaking that is plainly dull and visually ugly when it is nt incomprehensible .
>2
if festival in cannes nails hard  boiled hollywood argot with a bracingly nasty accuracy , much about the film , including some of its casting , is frustratingly unconvincing .
>2
i have nt seen such selfamused trash since freddy got fingered .
>2
little more than a wellmounted history lesson .
>2
rob schneider s infantile crossdressing routines fill the hot chick , the latest gimmick from this unimaginative comedian .
>2
a horrible , 99minute stink bomb .
>2
the film is weighed down by supporting characters who are either too goodly , wise and knowing or downright comically evil .
>2
the film is so bad it does nt improve upon the experience of staring at a blank screen .
>2
sheridan s take on the author s schoolboy memoir ... is a rather toothless take on a hard young life .
>2
it jumps around with little logic or continuity , presenting backstage bytes of information that never amount to a satisfying complete picture of this particular , anciently demanding mtier .
>2
when it comes to the battle of hollywood vs. woo , it looks like woo s a p.o.w.
>2
the chateau has one very funny joke and a few other decent ones , but all it amounts to is a mildly funny , sometimes tedious , ultimately insignificant film .
>2
it s dull , spiritless , silly and monotonous  an ultraloud blast of pointless mayhem , going nowhere fast .
>1
the mushy finale turns john q into a movieoftheweek tearjerker .
>2
content merely to lionize its title character and exploit his anger  all for easy sanctimony , formulaic thrills and a hamfisted sermon on the need for national health insurance .
>2
its message has merit and , in the hands of a brutally honest individual like prophet jack , might have made a point or two regarding life .
>2
it s hard to imagine that even very small children will be impressed by this tired retread .
>2
neither as scaryfunny as tremors nor dementedfunny as starship troopers , the movie is nt tough to take as long as you ve paid a matinee price .
>2
if swimfan does catch on , it may be because teens are looking for something to make them laugh .
>2
the master of disguise may have made a great saturday night live sketch , but a great movie it is not .
>2
it s quite an achievement to set and shoot a movie at the cannes film festival and yet fail to capture its visual appeal or its atmosphere .
>2
boll uses a lot of quick cutting and blurry stepprinting to goose things up , but dopey dialogue and sometimes inadequate performances kill the effect .
>2
it s always disappointing when a documentary fails to live up to  or offer any new insight into  its chosen topic .
>2
unfortunately , that s precisely what arthur dong s family fundamentals does .
>2
like a mediumgrade network sitcom  mostly inoffensive , fitfully amusing , but ultimately so weightless that a decent draft in the auditorium might blow it off the screen .
>2
something must have been lost in the translation .
>2
becomes the last thing you would expect from a film with this title or indeed from any plympton film  boring .
>2
in the end , the film feels homogenized and a bit contrived , as if we re looking back at a tattered and ugly past with rosetinted glasses .
>2
chan s stunts are limited and so embellished by editing that there s really not much of a sense of action or even actioncomedy .
>2
rock s standup magic wanes .
>1
hopkins , squarely fills the screen .
>2
action  mechanical .
>1
alas , it s the man that makes the clothes .
>2
for casual moviegoers who stumble into rules expecting a slice of american pie hijinks starring the kid from dawson s creek , they ll probably run out screaming .
>2
plot , characters , drama , emotions , ideas  all are irrelevant to the experience of seeing the scorpion king .
>1
city by the sea is a gritty police thriller with all the dysfunctional family dynamics one could wish for .
>2
but how it washed out despite all of that is the project s prime mystery .
>2
whatever the movie s sentimental , hypocritical lessons about sexism , its true colors come out in various wet tshirt and shower scenes .
>1
i enjoyed the movie in a superficial way , while never sure what its purpose was .
>2
what a pity ... that the material is so secondrate .
>2
does nt deliver a great story , nor is the action as gripping as in past seagal films .
>2
the kind of film that leaves you scratching your head in amazement over the fact that so many talented people could participate in such an illadvised and poorly executed idea .
>1
nicks refuses to let slackers be seen as just another teen movie , which means he can be forgiven for frequently pandering to fans of the grossout comedy .
>2
nothing about the film  with the possible exception of elizabeth hurley s breasts  is authentic .
>2
mostly , shafer and cowriter gregory hinton lack a strongminded viewpoint , or a sense of humor .
>2
no cliche escapes the perfervid treatment of gang warfare called ces wild .
>2
eddie murphy and owen wilson have a cute partnership in i spy , but the movie around them is so often nearly nothing that their charm does nt do a load of good .
>2
strictly a  guy s film  in the worst sense of the expression .
>2
there s some good material in their story about a retail clerk wanting more out of life , but the movie too often spins its wheels with familiar situations and repetitive scenes .
>2
it s a lot to ask people to sit still for two hours and change watching such a character , especially when rendered in as flat and impassive a manner as phoenix s .
>2
there s something fishy about a seasonal holiday kids  movie ... that derives its moment of most convincing emotional gravity from a scene where santa gives gifts to grownups .
>2
we re left with a story that tries to grab us , only to keep letting go at all the wrong moments .
>2
like many such biographical melodramas , it suffers from the awkwardness that results from adhering to the messiness of true stories .
>2
there is nothing redeeming about this movie .
>2
i was trying to decide what annoyed me most about god is great ... i m not , and then i realized that i just did nt care .
>2
derailed by bad writing and possibly also by some of that extensive postproduction reworking to aim the film at young males in the throes of their first full flush of testosterone .
>2
... comes alive only when it switches gears to the sentimental .
>2
brosnan s finest nonbondish performance yet fails to overcome the film s manipulative sentimentality and annoying stereotypes .
>1
a film that will be best appreciated by those willing to endure its extremely languorous rhythms , waiting for happiness is ultimately thoughtful without having much dramatic impact .
>2
to me , it sounds like a cruel deception carried out by men of marginal intelligence , with reactionary ideas about women and a total lack of empathy .
>2
flashy gadgets and whirling fight sequences may look cool , but they ca nt distract from the flawed support structure holding equilibrium up .
>2
zigzag might have been richer and more observant if it were less densely plotted .
>2
how can such a cold movie claim to express warmth and longing ?
>2
nicks and steinberg match their own creations for pure venality  that s giving it the old college try .
>2
episode ii  attack of the clones is a technological exercise that lacks juice and delight .
>2
the problem with all of this  it s not really funny .
>2
overall tomfoolery like this is a matter of taste .
>2
the mantra behind the project seems to have been  it s just a kids  flick . 
>2
translation   we do nt need to try very hard . 
>2
in all the annals of the movies , few films have been this odd , inexplicable and unpleasant .
>2
it takes a really long , slow and dreary time to dope out what tuck everlasting is about .
>2
an essentially awkward version of the lightweight female empowerment picture we ve been watching for decades
>2
the author s devotees will probably find it fascinating  others may find it baffling .
>2
writerdirector walter hill and cowriter david giler try to create characters out of the obvious cliches , but wind up using them as punching bags .
>2
there s a scientific law to be discerned here that producers would be well to heed  mediocre movies start to drag as soon as the action speeds up  when the explosions start , they fall to pieces .
>2
a cockeyed shot all the way .
>2
unfortunately , one hour photo lives down to its title .
>2
thanks largely to williams , all the interesting developments are processed in 60 minutes  the rest is just an overexposed waste of film .
>2
cold , sterile and lacking any color or warmth .
>2
the film is undone by anachronistic quick edits and occasional jarring glimpses of a modern theater audience watching the events unfold .
>2
seems like someone going through the motions .
>2
for a film about explosions and death and spies ,  ballistic  ecks vs. sever  seems as safe as a children s film .
>2
well , in some of those , the mother deer even dies .
>2
choppy , overlong documentary about  the lifestyle . 
>2
one sloughs one s way through the mire of this alleged psychological thriller in search of purpose or even a plot .
>2
a film which presses familiar herzog tropes into the service of a limpid and conventional historical fiction , when really what we demand of the director is to be mesmerised .
>1
brought to life on the big screen .
>2
the story itself is actually quite vapid .
>2
it s a hellish , numbing experience to watch , and it does nt offer any insights that have nt been thoroughly debated in the media already , back in the dahmer heyday of the mid  90s .
>2
a few zingers aside , the writing is indifferent , and jordan brady s direction is prosaic .
>2
each scene drags , underscoring the obvious , and sentiment is slathered on top .
>2
would ve been nice if the screenwriters had trusted audiences to understand a complex story , and left off the film s predictable denouement .
>2
nair just does nt have the necessary selfcontrol to guide a loose , poorly structured film through the pitfalls of incoherence and redundancy .
>1
enthusiastically taking up the current teen movie concern with bodily functions , walt becker s film pushes all the demographically appropriate comic buttons .
>1
it s the funniest american comedy since graffiti bridge .
>2
that neither protagonist has a distinguishable condition hardly matters because both are just actory concoctions , defined by childlike dimness and a handful of quirks .
>2
what starts off as a possible argentine american beauty reeks like a room stacked with pungent flowers .
>2
the project s filmmakers forgot to include anything even halfway scary as they poorly rejigger fatal attraction into a high school setting .
>2
in oldfashioned screenwriting parlance , ms. shreve s novel proved too difficult a text to  lick ,  despite the efforts of a firstrate cast .
>2
solondz may well be the only one laughing at his own joke
>2
stitch is a bad mannered , ugly and destructive little  .
>2
no cute factor here ... not that i mind ugly  the problem is he has no character , loveable or otherwise .
>2
deep down , i realized the harsh reality of my situation  i would leave the theater with a lower i.q. than when i had entered .
>2
aside from the fact that the film idiotically uses the website feardotcom.com or the improperly hammy performance from poor stephen rea , the film gets added disdain for the fact that it is nearly impossible to look at or understand .
>2
it is bad , but certainly not without merit as entertainment .
>2
for its 100 minutes running time , you ll wait in vain for a movie to happen .
>2
a work that lacks both a purpose and a strong pulse .
>1
a faster paced family flick .
>2
upper teens may get cynical .
>1
smaller numbered kidlets will enjoy .
>2
while this film has an  a  list cast and some strong supporting players , the tale  like its central figure , vivi  is just a little bit hard to love .
>2
it s a roadtrip drama with too many wrong turns .
>2
most fish stories are a little peculiar , but this is one that should be thrown back in the river .
>2
the movie is about as deep as that sentiment .
>2
i ve seen some bad singerturned actors , but lil bow wow takes the cake .
>1
by halfway through this picture i was beginning to hate it , and , of course , feeling guilty for it ... then , miracle of miracles , the movie does a flipflop .
>1
made eddie murphy a movie star and the man has nt aged a day .
>2
but it was nt .
>2
for a film about action , ultimate x is the gabbiest giantscreen movie ever , bogging down in a barrage of hype .
>2
... a low rate annie featuring some kid who ca nt act , only echoes of jordan , and weirdo actor crispin glover screwing things up old school .
>2
it might not be 1970s animation , but everything else about it is straight from the saturday morning cartoons  a retread story , bad writing , and the same old silliness .
>2
the picture seems uncertain whether it wants to be an acidic allmale all about eve or a lush , swooning melodrama in the intermezzo strain .
>2
a nearly 212 hours , the film is way too indulgent .
>2
gorgeous to look at but insufferably tedious and turgid ... a curiously constricted epic .
>2
with a tighter editorial process and firmer direction this material could work , especially since the actresses in the lead roles are all more than competent , but as is , personal velocity seems to be idling in neutral .
>2
does nt really add up to much .
>2
it s better suited for the history or biography channel , but there s no arguing the tone of the movie  it leaves a bad taste in your mouth and questions on your mind .
>2
an entertainment so in love with its overinflated mythology that it no longer recognizes the needs of moviegoers for real characters and compelling plots .
>2
a prolonged extrusion of psychopathic pulp .
>2
borrows from other movies like it in the most ordinary and obvious fashion .
>2
it s surprisingly bland despite the heavy doses of weird performances and direction .
>2
a chilly , remote , emotionally distant piece ... so dull that its tagline should be   in space , no one can hear you snore . 
>2
the characters seem onedimensional , and the film is superficial and will probably be of interest primarily to its target audience .
>2
sorvino makes the princess seem smug and cartoonish , and the film only really comes alive when poor hermocrates and leontine pathetically compare notes about their budding amours .
>2
it s like a driveby .
>2
you can drive right by it without noticing anything special , save for a few comic turns , intended and otherwise .
>2
everything  even life on an aircraft carrier  is sentimentalized .
>2
this wouldbe  james bond for the extreme generation  pic is one big , dumb action movie .
>2
stress  dumb . 
>2
when your subject is illusion versus reality , should nt the reality seem at least passably real ?
>2
it s a terrible movie in every regard , and utterly painful to watch .
>2
a fan film that for the uninitiated plays better on video with the sound turned down .
>2
too infuriatingly quirky and taken with its own style .
>2
there s a whole heap of nothing at the core of this slight comingofagecomingout tale .
>1
as much as i laughed throughout the movie , i can not mount a cogent defense of the film as entertainment , or even performance art , although the movie does leave you marveling at these guys  superhuman capacity to withstand pain .
>2
distinctly subpar ... more likely to drown a viewer in boredom than to send any shivers down his spine .
>2
plays like a bad blend of an overripe episode of tv s dawson s creek and a recycled and dumbeddown version of love story .
>2
unless you come in to the film with a skateboard under your arm , you re going to feel like you were nt invited to the party .
>2
when the casting call for this movie went out , it must have read  seeking anyone with acting ambition but no sense of pride or shame . 
>2
just is nt as weird as it ought to be .
>2
a  home alone  film that is staged like  rosemary s baby ,  but is not as wellconceived as either of those films .
>2
no film could possibly be more contemptuous of the single female population .
>2
a sluggish pace and lack of genuine narrative hem the movie in every bit as much as life hems in the spirits of these young women .
>2
a lowbudget affair , tadpole was shot on digital video , and the images often look smeary and blurry , to the point of distraction .
>2
then again , in a better movie , you might not have noticed .
>2
the movie is like a year late for tapping into our reality tv obsession , and even tardier for exploiting the novelty of the  webcast . 
>2
tale will be all too familiar for anyone who s seen george roy hill s 1973 film ,  the sting . 
>2
gets the look and the period trappings right , but it otherwise drowns in a sea of visual and verbal clichs .
>1
it s hard to quibble with a flick boasting this many genuine cackles , but notorious c.h.o. still feels like a promising workinprogress .
>2
anyone who wants to start writing screenplays can just follow the same blueprint from hundreds of other films , sell it to the highest bidder and walk away without anyone truly knowing your identity .
>2
the problem with the bread , my sweet is that it s far too sentimental .
>2
never inspires more than an interested detachment .
>2
despite slick production values and director roger michell s ticktock pacing , the final effect is like having two guys yelling in your face for two hours .
>2
pretty much sucks , but has a funny moment or two .
>2
a supernatural mystery that does nt know whether it wants to be a suspenseful horror movie or a weepy melodrama .
>2
it ends up being neither , and fails at both endeavors .
>2
two badly interlocked stories drowned by all too clever complexity .
>2
these are textbook lives of quiet desperation .
>2
claims to sort the bad guys from the good , which is its essential problem .
>2
purposefully shocking in its eroticized gore , if unintentionally dull in its lack of poetic frissons .
>2
feels like pieces a bunch of other , better movies slapped together .
>2
almost everything about the film is unsettling , from the preposterous hairpiece worn by lai s villainous father to the endless action sequences .
>2
writerdirector randall wallace has bitten off more than he or anyone else could chew , and his movie veers like a drunken driver through heavy traffic .
>2
it follows the blair witch formula for an hour , in which we re told something creepy and vague is in the works , and then it goes awry in the final 30 minutes .
>2
one ca nt shake the feeling that crossroads is nothing more than an hourandahalflong commercial for britney s latest album .
>2
phonedin business as usual .
>2
what little atmosphere is generated by the shadowy lighting , macabre sets , and endless rain is offset by the sheer ugliness of everything else .
>2
tartakovsky s team has some freakish powers of visual charm , but the five writers slip into the modern rut of narrative banality .
>2
the most horrific movie experience i ve had since  ca nt stop the music . 
>2
it may as well be called  jarjar binks  the movie . 
>2
it s that painful .
>2
like a threering circus , there are side stories aplenty  none of them memorable .
>2
a  girls gone wild  video for the boho arthouse crowd , the burning sensation is nt a definitive countercultural document  its makers are nt removed and inquisitive enough for that .
>2
as original and insightful as last week s episode of behind the music .
>2
plays like john le carr with a couple of burntout cylinders .
>2
you may be galled that you ve wasted nearly two hours of your own precious life with this silly little puddle of a movie .
>1
it s neither as sappy as big daddy nor as anarchic as happy gilmore or the waterboy , but it has its moments .
>1
despite the surface attractions  conrad l. hall s cinematography will likely be nominated for an oscar next year  there s something impressive and yet lacking about everything .
>2
a smug and convoluted actioncomedy that does nt allow an earnest moment to pass without reminding audiences that it s only a movie .
>2
worthless , from its pseudorockvideo opening to the idiocy of its last frames .
>2
the christ allegory does nt work because there is no foundation for it
>2
it s hard to care about a film that proposes as epic tragedy the plight of a callow rich boy who is forced to choose between his beautiful , selfsatisfied 22yearold girlfriend and an equally beautiful , selfsatisfied 18yearold mistress .
>2
tries too hard to be funny in a way that s too loud , too goofy and too short of an attention span .
>2
i did nt find much fascination in the swinging .
>2
what they re doing is a matter of plumbing arrangements and mind games , of no erotic or sensuous charge .
>1
but that they are doing it is thoughtprovoking .
>2
the acting is just fine , but there s not enough substance here to sustain interest for the full 90 minutes , especially with the weak payoff .
>2
after collateral damage , you might imagine that most every aggrieved father clich has been unturned .
>2
ultimately the , yes , snaillike pacing and lack of thematic resonance make the film more silly than scary , like some sort of martha stewart decorating program run amok .
>2
releasing a film with the word  dog  in its title in january lends itself to easy jokes and insults , and snow dogs deserves every single one of them .
>2
tedious norwegian offering which somehow snagged an oscar nomination .
>2
a darkaspitch comedy that frequently veers into corny sentimentality , probably would not improve much after a therapeutic zap of shock treatment .
>2
bray is completely at sea  with nothing but a savage garden music video on his resume , he has no clue about making a movie .
>2
a huge disappointment coming , as it does , from filmmakers and performers of this calibre
>2
though it pretends to expose the life of male hustlers , it s exploitive without being insightful .
>2
what starts off as a satisfying kids flck becomes increasingly implausible as it races through contrived plot points .
>2
exhibits the shallow sensationalism characteristic of soap opera ... more salacious telenovela than serious drama .
>2
seagal is painfully foolish in trying to hold onto what s left of his passe  chopsocky glory .
>2
the story is bogus and its characters tissuethin .
>2
whereas the extremely competent hitman films such as pulp fiction and get shorty resonate a sardonic verve to their caustic purpose for existing , who is cletis tout ?
>2
is an inexpressible and drab wannabe looking for that exact niche .
>2
imagine a film that begins as a seven ripoff , only to switch to a mix of the shining , the thing , and any naked teenagers horror flick from the 1980s .
>2
most of the dialogue made me want to pack raw dough in my ears .
>2
costner s warmmilk persona is just as illfitting as shadyac s perfunctory directing chops , and some of the more overtly silly dialogue would sink laurence olivier .
>2
it s coherent , well shot , and tartly acted , but it wears you down like a dinner guest showing off his doctorate .
>1
directed by kevin bray , whose crisp framing , edgy camera work , and wholesale ineptitude with acting , tone and pace very obviously mark him as a video helmer making his feature debut .
>2
turns a potentially interesting idea into an excruciating film school experience that plays better only for the film s publicists or for people who take as many drugs as the film s characters
>2
high crimes is a cinematic misdemeanor , a routine crime thriller remarkable only for its lack of logic and misuse of two fine actors , morgan freeman and ashley judd .
>2
set in a 1986 harlem that does nt look much like anywhere in new york .
>2
the chocolate factory without charlie .
>2
long on twinklyeyed closeups and short on shame .
>2
hiphop rarely comes alive as its own firebreathing entity in this picture .
>2
a dull , somnambulant exercise in pretension whose pervasive quiet is broken by frequent outbursts of violence and noise .
>2
deserving of its critical backlash and more .
>2
still , it just sits there like a side dish no one ordered .
>2
this lowrent  and even lowerwit  ripoff of the farrelly brothers  oeuvre gets way too mushy  and in a relatively short amount of time .
>2
it recycles every clich about gays in what is essentially an extended soap opera .
>2
i m all for the mentally challenged getting their fair shot in the movie business , but surely it does nt have to be as a collection of keening and selfmutilating sideshow geeks .
>2
may offend viewers not amused by the sick sense of humor .
>2
many of benjamins  elements feel like they ve been patched in from an episode of miami vice .
>2
it aimlessly and unsuccessfully attempts to fuse at least three dull plots into one good one .
>2
if you re not fans of the adventues of steve and terri , you should avoid this like the dreaded king brown snake .
>2
personally , i d rather watch them on the animal planet .
>2
cherish is a dud  a romantic comedy that s not the least bit romantic and only mildly funny .
>2
all of the filmmakers  calculations ca nt rescue brown sugar from the curse of blandness .
>2
... postseptember 11 ,  the sum of all fears  seems more tacky and reprehensible , manipulating our collective fear without bestowing the subject with the intelligence or sincerity it unequivocally deserves .
>2
the exclamation point seems to be the only bit of glee you ll find in this dreary mess .
>2
godard s ode to tackling life s wonderment is a rambling and incoherent manifesto about the vagueness of topical excess ... in praise of love remains a ponderous and pretentious endeavor that s unfocused and tediously exasperating .
>2
humorless , selfconscious art drivel , made without a glimmer of intelligence or invention .
>2
the movie s progression into rambling incoherence gives new meaning to the phrase  fatal script error . 
>2
solondz may be convinced that he has something significant to say , but he is nt talking a talk that appeals to me .
>2
more tiring than anything .
>2
nelson s intentions are good , but the end result does no justice to the story itself .
>2
it s horribly depressing and not very well done .
>2
... the efforts of its star , kline , to lend some dignity to a dumb story are for naught .
>2
a goodnatured ensemble comedy that tries hard to make the most of a bumper cast , but never quite gets off the ground .
>2
is nt it a bit early in his career for director barry sonnenfeld to do a homage to himself ?
>2
and it s a lousy one at that .
>2
overly long and worshipful biodoc .
>1
i ll go out on a limb .
>2
it is nt quite one of the worst movies of the year .
>2
it s just merely very bad .
>2
writerdirector ritchie reduces wertmuller s social mores and politics to tiresome jargon .
>2
everything about girls ca nt swim , even its passages of sensitive observation , feels secondhand , familiar  and not in a good way .
>2
feels aimless for much of its running time , until late in the film when a tidal wave of plot arrives , leaving questions in its wake .
>2
in my own very humble opinion , in praise of love lacks even the most fragmented charms i have found in almost all of his previous works .
>2
the script is too mainstream and the psychology too textbook to intrigue .
>2
muddled , simplistic and more than a little pretentious .
>2
a disaster of a drama , saved only by its winged assailants .
>2
director elie chouraqui , who cowrote the script , catches the chaotic horror of war , but why bother if you re going to subjugate truth to the tearjerking demands of soap opera ?
>2
dong never pushes for insights beyond the superficial tensions of the dynamic he s dissecting , and the film settles too easily along the contours of expectation .
>2
if there was any doubt that peter ofallon did nt have an original bone in his body , a rumor of angels should dispel it .
>2
an occasionally interesting but mostly repetitive look at a slice of counterculture that might be best forgotten .
>2
what could have been right at home as a nifty plot line in steven soderbergh s traffic fails to arrive at any satisfying destination .
>2
the movie is like scorsese s mean streets redone by someone who ignored it in favor of old  juvenile delinquent  paperbacks with titles like leather warriors and switchblade sexpot .
>2
this pathetic junk is barely an hour long .
>2
nevertheless , it still seems endless .
>2
it is nt that stealing harvard is a horrible movie  if only it were that grand a failure !
>2
it s just that it s so notatallgood .
>2
is it possible for a documentary to be utterly entranced by its subject and still show virtually no understanding of it ?
>2
it s supposed to be a romantic comedy  it suffers from too much norma rae and not enough pretty woman .
>2
the leads are so unmemorable , despite several attempts at lengthy dialogue scenes , that one eventually resents having to inhale this gutter romancer s secondhand material .
>2
staggers between flaccid satire and what is supposed to be madcap farce .
>2
not that any of us should be complaining when a film clocks in around 90 minutes these days , but the plotting here leaves a lot to be desired .
>2
plays like the old diseaseoftheweek smallscreen melodramas .
>2
like life on the island , the movie grows boring despite the scenery .
>2
the truth about charlie is that it s a brazenly misguided project .
>2
so exaggerated and broad that it comes off as annoying rather than charming .
>2
an awkward hybrid of genres that just does nt work .
>2
the latest vapid actor s exercise to appropriate the structure of arthur schnitzler s reigen .
>2
snipes is both a snore and utter tripe .
>2
ritchie s film is easier to swallow than wertmuller s polemical allegory , but it s selfdefeatingly decorous .
>2
chalk it up as the worst kind of hubristic folly .
>2
it s the kind of underinspired , overblown enterprise that gives hollywood sequels a bad name .
>2
even murphy s expert comic timing and famed charisma ca nt rescue this effort .
>2
a sleek advert for youthful anomie that never quite equals the sum of its pretensions .
>2
some body smacks of exhibitionism more than it does cathartic truth telling .
>2
apparently , romantic comedy with a fresh point of view just does nt figure in the present hollywood program .
>2
depressingly thin and exhaustingly contrived .
>2
only masochistic moviegoers need apply .
>2
a movie that s held captive by mediocrity .
>1
what s next ?
>2
david spade as citizen kane ?
>2
the problem , amazingly enough , is the screenplay .
>2
it s a frankensteinmonster of a film that does nt know what it wants to be .
>2
upper west sidey exercise in narcissism and selfcongratulation disguised as a tribute .
>2
on its icy face , the new film is a subzero version of monsters , inc. , without the latter s imagination , visual charm or texture .
>2
i ca nt say this enough  this movie is about an adult male dressed in pink jammies .
>2
it s a mindless action flick with a twist  far better suited to videoviewing than the multiplex .
>2
after a while , the only way for a reasonably intelligent person to get through the country bears is to ponder how a whole segment of popmusic history has been allowed to get wet , fuzzy and sticky .
>2
the film is grossly contradictory in conveying its social message , if indeed there is one .
>2
often lingers just as long on the irrelevant as on the engaging , which gradually turns what time is it there ?
>2
into how long is this movie ?
>2
too bad kramer could nt make a guest appearance to liven things up .
>2
deuces wild is an encyclopedia of cliches that shoplifts shamelessly from farewelltoinnocence movies like the wanderers and a bronx tale without cribbing any of their intelligence .
>2
it s a barely tolerable slog over welltrod ground .
>2
epps has neither the charisma nor the natural affability that has made tucker a star .
>2
it s sweet ... but just a little bit too precious at the start and a little too familiar at the end .
>2
a dull , dumb and derivative horror film .
>2
an awkwardly contrived exercise in magic realism .
>2
demme gets a lot of flavor and spice into his charade remake , but he ca nt disguise that he s spiffing up leftovers that are nt so substantial or fresh .
>2
this is a heartfelt story ... it just is nt a very involving one .
>2
these selfstyled athletes have banged their brains into the ground so frequently and furiously , their capacity to explain themselves has gone the same way as their natural instinct for selfpreservation .
>2
the fact that the  best part  of the movie comes from a 60second homage to one of demme s good films does nt bode well for the rest of it .
>2
richard pryor mined his personal horrors and came up with a treasure chest of material , but lawrence gives us mostly fool s gold .
>2
... built on the premise that middleclass arkansas consists of monster truckloving good ol boys and peroxide blond honeys whose worldly knowledge comes from tv reruns and supermarket tabloids .
>2
a laughable  or rather , unlaughable  excuse for a film .
>2
like a grinning jack o  lantern , its apparent glee is derived from a lobotomy , having had all its vital essence scooped out and discarded .
>1
a sentimental hybrid that could benefit from the spice of specificity .
>2
give shapiro , goldman , and bolado credit for good intentions , but there s nothing here that they could nt have done in half an hour .
>2
it s so devoid of joy and energy it makes even jason x ... look positively shakesperean by comparison .
>2
one of the worst films of 2002 .
>2
plays like an unbalanced mixture of graphic combat footage and almost saccharine domestic interludes that are pure hollywood .
>2
mctiernan s remake may be lighter on its feet  the soberminded original was as graceful as a tapdancing rhino  but it is just as boring and as obvious .
>2
high crimes carries almost no organic intrigue as a government  marinelegal mystery , and that s because the movie serves up all of that stuff , nearly subliminally , as the oldhat province of male intrigue .
>2
this movie is about the worst thing chan has done in the united states .
>2
the explosion essentially ruined  or , rather , overpowered  the fiction of the movie for me .
>2
this ludicrous film is predictable at every turn .
>2
an incredibly irritating comedy about thoroughly vacuous people ... manages to embody the worst excesses of nouvelle vague without any of its sense of fun or energy .
>2
the film desperately sinks further and further into comedy futility .
>2
instead of a balanced film that explains the zeitgeist that is the x games , we get a cinematic postcard that s superficial and unrealized .
>2
the crassness of this reactionary thriller is matched only by the ridiculousness of its premise .
>2
i wish it would have just gone more overthetop instead of trying to have it both ways .
>2
the film does nt really care about the thousands of americans who die hideously , it cares about how ryan meets his future wife and makes his start at the cia .
>2
adrift , bentley and hudson stare and sniffle , respectively , as ledger attempts , in vain , to prove that moviestar intensity can overcome bad hair design .
>2
after an hour and a half of wondering  sometimes amusedly , sometimes impatiently  just what this strenuously unconventional movie is supposed to be , you discover that the answer is as conventional as can be .
>2
 linklater fans , or pretentious types who want to appear avantgarde will suck up to this project ... 
>2
a woefully dull , redundant concept that bears more than a whiff of exploitation , despite iwai s vaunted empathy .
>2
if you really want to understand what this story is really all about , you re far better served by the source material .
>2
it s mildly sentimental , unabashedly consumerist ... studiously inoffensive and completely disposable .
>2
like its title character , esther kahn is unusual but unfortunately also irritating .
>2
the star who helped give a spark to  chasing amy  and  changing lanes  falls flat as thinking man cia agent jack ryan in this summer s new action film ,  the sum of all fears . 
>2
a summary of the plot does nt quite do justice to the awfulness of the movie , for that comes through all too painfully in the execution .
>2
every conceivable mistake a director could make in filming opera has been perpetrated here .
>2
snoots will no doubt rally to its cause , trotting out threadbare standbys like  masterpiece  and  triumph  and all that malarkey , but rarely does an established filmmaker so ardently waste viewers  time with a gobbler like this .
>1
any enjoyment will be hinge from a personal threshold of watching sad but endearing characters do extremely unconventional things .
>2
interminably bleak , to say nothing of boring .
>2
things really get weird , though not particularly scary  the movie is all portent and no content .
>1
oh , look at that clever angle !
>2
demme finally succeeds in diminishing his stature from oscarwinning master to lowly studio hack .
>2
the action scenes have all the suspense of a 20car pileup , while the plot holes are big enough for a train car to drive through  if kaos had nt blown them all up .
>2
it almost feels as if the movie is more interested in entertaining itself than in amusing us .
>1
it puts washington , as honest working man john q. archibald , on a pedestal , then keeps lifting the pedestal higher .
>2
ultimately , the film amounts to being lectured to by techgeeks , if you re up for that sort of thing .
>1
far more enjoyable than its predecessor .
>2
full frontal , which opens today nationwide , could almost be classified as a movieindustry satire , but it lacks the generous inclusiveness that is the genre s definitive , if disingenuous , feature .
>2
a ragbag of cliches .
>2
the three leads produce adequate performances , but what s missing from this material is any depth of feeling .
>2
it s possible that something hip and transgressive was being attempted here that stubbornly refused to gel , but the result is more puzzling than unsettling .
>2
this painfully unfunny farce traffics in tired stereotypes and encumbers itself with complications ... that have no bearing on the story .
>1
short and sweet , but also more than anything else slight ... tadpole pulls back from the consequences of its own actions and revelations .
>2
what more can be expected from a college comedy that s target audience has nt graduated from junior high school ?
>2
the plan to make enough into  an inspiring tale of survival wrapped in the heartpounding suspense of a stylish psychological thriller  has flopped as surely as a souffl gone wrong .
>1
instead of letting the laughs come as they may , lawrence unleashes his trademark misogyny  er , comedy  like a human volcano or an overflowing septic tank , take your pick .
>2
just send it to cranky .
>2
we do nt get paid enough to sit through crap like this .
>2
an even more predictable , clicheridden endeavor than its predecessor .
>2
the whole thing plays like a tired tyco ad .
>2
the film does nt show enough of the creative process or even of what was created for the nonfan to figure out what makes wilco a big deal .
>2
no , i do nt know why steven seagal is considered a star , nor why he keeps being cast in action films when none of them are ever any good or make any money .
>2
even by the intentionally low standards of fratboy humor , sorority boys is a bowser .
>2
one welltimed explosion in a movie can be a knockout , but a hundred of them can be numbing .
>2
halfway through , however , having sucked dry the undead action flick formula , blade ii mutates into a grossout monster movie with effects that are more silly than scary .
>2
weighted down with slow , uninvolving storytelling and flat acting .
>2
we ca nt accuse kung pow for misfiring , since it is exactly what it wants to be  an atrociously , mindnumbingly , indescribably bad movie .
>2
unfortunately , we d prefer a simple misfire .
>2
there is nt one moment in the film that surprises or delights .
>2
most of the information has already appeared in one forum or another and , no matter how broomfield dresses it up , it tends to speculation , conspiracy theories or , at best , circumstantial evidence .
>2
this movie , a certain scene in particular , brought me uncomfortably close to losing my lunch .
>2
the secrets of time travel will have been discovered , indulged in and rejected as boring before i see this piece of crap again .
>2
chelsea walls is a case of too many chefs fussing over too weak a recipe .
>2
every joke is repeated at least four times .
>2
every joke is repeated at least four times .
>2
every joke is repeated at least  annoying , is nt it ?
>2
comes across as a fairly weak retooling .
>2
the lousy lead performances ... keep the movie from ever reaching the comic heights it obviously desired .
>2
its and pieces of the hot chick are so hilarious , and schneider s performance is so fine , it s a real shame that so much of the movie  again , as in the animal  is a slapdash mess .
>2
the movie resolutely avoids all the comic possibilities of its situation , and becomes one more dumb high school comedy about sex gags and prom dates .
>1
earnest and heartfelt but undernourished and plodding .
>2
a sugarcoated rocky whose valuable messages are forgotten 10 minutes after the last trombone honks .
>2
romanek keeps adding flourishes  artsy fantasy sequences  that simply feel wrong .
>2
they cheapen the overall effect .
>2
has all the complexity and realistic human behavior of an episode of general hospital .
>2
an acceptable way to pass a little over an hour with moviegoers ages 810 , but it s unlikely to inspire anything more than a visit to mcdonald s , let alone some savvy street activism .
>2
an exercise in cynicism every bit as ugly as the shabby digital photography and muddy sound .
>2
not good enough to pass for a litmus test of the generation gap and not bad enough to repulse any generation of its fans .
>2
the movie is silly beyond comprehension , and even if it were nt silly , it would still be beyond comprehension .
>2
watchable up until the point where the situations and the dialogue spin hopelessly out of control  that is to say , when carol kane appears on the screen .
>2
the scriptwriters are no less a menace to society than the film s characters .
>2
the film has a nearly terminal case of the cutes , and it s neither as funny nor as charming as it thinks it is .
>2
more a gunfest than a rock concert .
>2
it s a frightful vanity film that , no doubt , pays off what debt miramax felt they owed to benigni .
>2
a muddy psychological thriller rife with miscalculations .
>2
it makes me say the obvious  abandon all hope of a good movie ye who enter here .
>2
it s not original enough .
>2
a listless scifi comedy in which eddie murphy deploys two guises and elaborate futuristic sets to no particularly memorable effect .
>2
a generic bloodbath that often becomes laughably unbearable when it is nt merely offensive .
>2
an unholy mess , driven by the pathetic idea that if you shoot something on crummylooking videotape , it must be labelled  hip  ,  innovative  and  realistic  .
>2
the story s pathetic and the gags are puerile . .
>2
curiously , super troopers suffers because it does nt have enough vices to merit its 103minute length .
>2
so bland and utterly forgettable that it might as well have been titled generic jennifer lopez romantic comedy .
>2
i still want my money back .
>2
it plods along methodically , somehow under the assumption that its  dead wife communicating from beyond the grave  framework is even remotely new or interesting .
>2
all too familiar ... basically the sort of cautionary tale that was old when  angels with dirty faces  appeared in 1938 .
>2
although purportedly a study in modern alienation , it s really little more than a particularly slanted , gay sm fantasy , enervating and deadeningly drawnout .
>2
after the first 10 minutes , which is worth seeing , the movie sinks into an abyss of clichs , depression and bad alternative music .
>2
no one can doubt the filmmakers  motives , but the guys still feels counterproductive .
>2
a very slow , uneventful ride around a pretty tattered old carousel .
>2
with little visible talent and no energy , colin hanks is in bad need of major acting lessons and maybe a little coffee .
>1
wellmeaning to a fault , antwone fisher manages the dubious feat of turning one man s triumph of will into everyman s romance comedy .
>2
seemingly disgusted with the lazy material and the finished product s unshapely look , director fisher stevens inexplicably dips key moments from the film in waking life water colors .
>2
formula 51 promises a new kind of high but delivers the same old bad trip .
>2
everything that was right about blade is wrong in its sequel .
>2
disney again ransacks its archives for a quickbuck sequel .
>2
coarse , cliched and clunky , this trifling romantic comedy in which opposites attract for no better reason than that the screenplay demands it squanders the charms of stars hugh grant and sandra bullock .
>2
anyone who suffers through this film deserves , at the very least , a big box of consolation candy .
>2
they presume their audience wo nt sit still for a sociology lesson , however entertainingly presented , so they trot out the conventional sciencefiction elements of bugeyed monsters and futuristic women in skimpy clothes .
>2
collapses after 30 minutes into a slaphappy series of adolescent violence .
>2
attal s hangups surrounding infidelity are so oldfashioned and , dare i say , outdated , it s a wonder that he could nt have brought something fresher to the proceedings simply by accident .
>2
obvious , obnoxious and didactic burlesque .
>2
the most surprising thing about this film is that they are actually releasing it into theaters .
>2
michele is a such a brainless flibbertigibbet that it s hard to take her spiritual quest at all seriously .
>2
enigma lacks it .
>2
pottymouthed enough for pg13 , yet not as hilariously raunchy as south park , this strangely schizo cartoon seems suited neither to kids or adults .
>2
a distinctly minor effort that will be seen to better advantage on cable , especially considering its barely featurelength running time of one hour .
>2
most of the movie is so deadly dull that watching the proverbial paint dry would be a welcome improvement .
>2
in the end , tuck everlasting falls victim to that everlasting conundrum experienced by every human who ever lived  too much to do , too little time to do it in .
>2
rather less than the sum of its underventilated prefils confrontations .
>2
mckay shows crushingly little curiosity about , or is illequipped to examine , the interior lives of the characters in his film , much less incorporate them into his narrative .
>2
plays like a series of vignettes  clips of a film that are still looking for a common throughline .
>2
amid the shock and curiosity factors , the film is just a corny examination of a young actress trying to find her way .
>2
yes , spirited away is a triumph of imagination , but it s also a failure of storytelling .
>2
a characteristically engorged and sloppy comingofage movie .
>2
whenever you think you ve seen the end of the movie , we cut to a new scene , which also appears to be the end .
>2
you begin to long for the end credits as the desert does for rain .
>2
the screenplay , cowritten by director imogen kimmel , lacks the wit necessary to fully exploit the comic elements of the premise , making the proceedings more bizarre than actually amusing .
>2
the milieu is wholly unconvincing ... and the histrionics reach a truly annoying pitch .
>2
unfunny comedy with a lot of static set ups , not much camera movement , and most of the scenes take place indoors in formal settings with motionless characters .
>2
each story is built on a potentially interesting idea , but the first two are ruined by amateurish writing and acting , while the third feels limited by its short running time .
>2
the laughs are as rare as snake foo yung .
>2
lazily and glumly settles into a most traditional , reserved kind of filmmaking .
>2
knockaround guys plays like a student film by two guys who desperately want to be quentin tarantino when they grow up .
>2
but they lack their idol s energy and passion for detail .
>2
mattei so completely loses himself to the film s circular structure to ever offer any insightful discourse on , well , love in the time of money .
>1
holland lets things peter out midway , but it s notably better acted  and far less crass  than some other recent efforts in the burgeoning genre of films about black urban professionals .
>2
for every articulate player , such as skateboarder tony hawk or bmx rider mat hoffman , are about a half dozen young turks angling to see how many times they can work the words  radical  or  suck  into a sentence .
>2
there s not a fresh idea at the core of this tale .
>2
an impenetrable and insufferable ball of pseudophilosophic twaddle .
>2
it s unfortunate that wallace , who wrote gibson s braveheart as well as the recent pearl harbor , has such an irrepressible passion for sappy situations and dialogue .
>1
i liked the movie , but i know i would have liked it more if it had just gone that one step further .
>2
i m left slightly disappointed that it did nt .
>2
dreary tale of middleclass angst
>2
for a movie about the power of poetry and passion , there is precious little of either .
>2
like schindler s list , the grey zone attempts to be grandiloquent , but ends up merely pretentious  in a grisly sort of way .
>2
an unremittingly ugly movie to look at , listen to , and think about , it is quite possibly the sturdiest example yet of why the dv revolution has cheapened the artistry of making a film .
>2
it s kind of sad that so many people put so much time and energy into this turkey .
>2
friday after next is a lot more bluster than bite .
>2
its juxtaposition of overwrought existentialism and stomachchurning gore will have you forever on the verge of either cracking up or throwing up .
>2
there are cheesy backdrops , ridiculous action sequences , and many tired jokes about men in heels .
>2
ice cube is nt quite out of ripe screwball ideas , but friday after next spreads them pretty thin .
>2
the characters , cast in impossibly contrived situations , are totally estranged from reality .
>2
just dreadful .
>2
i do nt blame eddie murphy but should nt owen wilson know a movie must have a story and a script ?
>2
hard as this may be to believe , here on earth , a surprisingly similar teen drama , was a better film .
>2
this is just lazy writing .
>2
even kids deserve better .
>2
the pretensions  and disposable story  sink the movie .
>2
and diesel is nt the actor to save it .
>1
frank capra played this story straight .
>2
but the 2002 film does nt really believe in it , and breaks the mood with absurdly inappropriate  comedy  scenes .
>2
the problem is that for the most part , the film is deadly dull .
>1
handled correctly , wilde s play is a masterpiece of elegant wit and artifice .
>2
here , alas , it collapses like an overcooked souffl .
>2
 sorority boys  was funnier , and that movie was pretty bad .
>2
a bizarre piece of work , with premise and dialogue at the level of kids  television and plot threads as morose as teen pregnancy , rape and suspected murder
>2
paul bettany is good at being the ultraviolent gangster wannabe , but the movie is certainly not number 1 .
>1
often likable , but just as often it s meandering , low on energy , and too eager to be quirky at moments when a little oldfashioned storytelling would come in handy .
>2
certain to be distasteful to children and adults alike , eight crazy nights is a total misfire .
>1
elaborate special effects take centre screen , so that the human story is pushed to one side .
>2
showtime is nt particularly assaultive , but it can still make you feel that you never want to see another car chase , explosion or gunfight again .
>2
all the characters are clinically depressed and have abandoned their slim hopes and dreams .
>2
this tuxedo ... should have been sent back to the tailor for some major alterations .
>2
but first , you have to give the audience a reason to want to put for that effort
>2
been there , done that ... a thousand times already , and better .
>2
what s most offensive is nt the waste of a good cast , but the film s denial of sincere grief and mourning in favor of bogus spiritualism .
>2
sunk by way too much indulgence of scenechewing , teethgnashing actorliness .
>2
fans of plympton s shorts may marginally enjoy the film , but it is doubtful this listless feature will win him any new viewers .
>2
none of this sounds promising and , indeed , the first half of sorority boys is as appalling as any  comedy  to ever spill from a projector s lens .
>2
the kind of movie that leaves vague impressions and a nasty aftertaste but little clear memory of its operational mechanics .
>2
 punchdrunk love is so convinced of its own brilliance that , if it were a person , you d want to smash its face in . 
>2
at once overly oldfashioned in its sudsy plotting and heavyhanded in its effort to modernize it with encomia to diversity and tolerance .
>2
the trashy teensleaze equivalent of showgirls .
>2
while the production details are lavish , film has little insight into the historical period and its artists , particularly in how sand developed a notorious reputation .
>2
a crass and insulting homage to great films like some like it hot and the john wayne classics .
>2
with all the sympathy , empathy and pity fogging up the screen ... his secret life enters the land of unintentional melodrama and tiresome love triangles .
>2
the problematic characters and overly convenient plot twists foul up shum s good intentions .
>2
what  blade runner  would ve looked like as a lowbudget series on a uhf channel .
>2
has all the values of a straighttovideo movie , but because it has a biggername cast , it gets a full theatrical release .
>2
with its lackadaisical plotting and mindless action , all about the benjamins evokes the bottom tier of blaxploitation flicks from the 1970s .
>1
it never quite makes it to the boiling point , but manages to sustain a good simmer for most of its running time .
>2
loud , silly , stupid and pointless .
>2
you ll find yourself wishing that you and they were in another movie .
>2
a yawnprovoking little farm melodrama .
>2
did no one on the set have a sense of humor , or did they not have the nerve to speak up ?
>2
seriously , rent the disney version .
>2
as david letterman and the onion have proven , the worst of tragedies can be fertile sources of humor , but lawrence has only a fleeting grasp of how to develop them .
>2
 abandon  will leave you wanting to abandon the theater .
>2
problem is , we have no idea what in creation is going on .
>1
a liveaction cartoon , a fastmoving and cheerfully simplistic 88 minutes of exaggerated action put together with the preteen boy in mind .
>2
a loquacious and dreary piece of business .
>2
director hoffman , his writer and kline s agent should serve detention
>1
meticulously mounted , exasperatingly wellbehaved film , which ticks off kahlo s lifetime milestones with the dutiful precision of a tax accountant .
>2
time of favor could have given audiences the time of day by concentrating on the elements of a revealing alienation among a culture of people who sadly are at hostile odds with one another through recklessness and retaliation .
>2
i m not sure which will take longer to heal  the welt on johnny knoxville s stomach from a riotcontrol projectile or my own tortured psyche .
>2
i m not sure which is worse  the poor acting by the ensemble cast , the flat dialogue by vincent r. nebrida or the gutless direction by laurice guillen .
>2
the only reason you should see this movie is if you have a case of masochism and an hour and a half to blow .
>2
as with so many merchandisedtothemax movies of this type , more time appears to have gone into recruiting the right bands for the playlist and the costuming of the stars than into the script , which has a handful of smart jokes and not much else .
>2
the irwins  scenes are fascinating  the movie as a whole is cheap junk and an insult to their deathdefying efforts .
>2
if routine action and jokes like this are your cup of tea , then pay your  8 and get ready for the big shear .
>2
this is one baaaaaaaaad movie .
>1
a man leaving the screening said the film was better than saving private ryan .
>2
but windtalkers does nt beat that one , either .
>2
may puzzle his most ardent fans .
>2
starts as a tart little lemon drop of a movie and ends up as a bitter pill .
>2
we never feel anything for these characters , and as a result the film is basically just a curiosity .
>2
feels like the work of an artist who is simply tired  of fighting the same fights , of putting the weight of the world on his shoulders , of playing with narrative form .
>2
while you have to admit it s semiamusing to watch robert deniro belt out  when you re a jet , you re a jet all the way ,  it s equally distasteful to watch him sing the lyrics to  tonight . 
>2
the whole mess boils down to a transparently hypocritical work that feels as though it s trying to set the women s liberation movement back 20 years . 
>2
... the cast portrays their cartoon counterparts well ... but quite frankly , scoob and shag do nt eat enough during the film . 
>2
more of the same old garbage hollywood has been trying to pass off as acceptable teen entertainment for some time now .
>2
tv skitcom material fervently deposited on the big screen .
>2
if there was ever a movie where the upbeat ending feels like a copout , this is the one .
>2
it s as sorry a mess as its director s diabolical debut , mad cows .
>2
any attempts at nuance given by the capable cast is drowned out by director jon purdy s sledgehammer sap .
>2
its audacious ambitions sabotaged by pomposity , steven soderbergh s space opera emerges as a numbingly dull experience .
>2
despite some strong performances , never rises above the level of a telanovela .
>2
unspeakable , of course , barely begins to describe the plot and its complications .
>2
vulgar is too optimistic a title .
>2
the characters never change .
>2
if the last man were the last movie left on earth , there would be a tossup between presiding over the end of cinema as we know it and another night of delightful hand shadows .
>1
welles groupiescholar peter bogdanovich took a long time to do it , but he s finally provided his own broadside at publishing giant william randolph hearst .
>2
makes the same mistake as the music industry it criticizes , becoming so slick and watereddown it almost loses what made you love it in the first place .
>2
even as i valiantly struggled to remain interested , or at least conscious , i could feel my eyelids ... getting ... very ... heavy ...
>2
a bad movie that happened to good actors .
>2
boasts eyecatching art direction but has a forcefully quirky tone that quickly wears out its limited welcome .
>1
screenwriter dan schneider and director shawn levy substitute volume and primary colors for humor and bite .
>2
oversexed , at times overwrought comedydrama that offers little insight into the experience of being forty , female and single .
>2
that such a horrible movie could have sprung from such a great one is one of the year s worst cinematic tragedies .
>2
it all starts to smack of a hallmark hall of fame , with a few four letter words thrown in that are generally not heard on television .
>2
rarely has a film s title served such dire warning .
>2
if you saw benigni s pinocchio at a public park , you d grab your kids and run and then probably call the police .
>2
mr. wollter and ms. seldhal give strong and convincing performances , but neither reaches into the deepest recesses of the character to unearth the quaking essence of passion , grief and fear .
>2
shafer s feature does nt offer much in terms of plot or acting .
>2
in his role of observer of the scene , lawrence sounds whiny and defensive , as if his lifealtering experiences made him bitter and less mature .
>2
the film did nt convince me that calvin jr. s barbershop represents some sort of beacon of hope in the middle of chicago s south side .
>2
what happens when something goes bump in the night and nobody cares ?
>2
despite some comic sparks , welcome to collinwood never catches fire .
>2
director george hickenlooper has had some success with documentaries , but here his sense of story and his juvenile camera movements smack of a film school undergrad , and his maudlin ending might not have gotten him into film school in the first place .
>2
shows moments of promise but ultimately succumbs to cliches and pat storytelling .
>2
even accepting this in the right frame of mind can only provide it with so much leniency .
>1
some body is a shaky , uncertain film that nevertheless touches a few raw nerves .
>2
all the small moments and flashbacks do nt add up to much more than trite observations on the human condition .
>2
one thing s for sure  if george romero had directed this movie , it would nt have taken the protagonists a full hour to determine that in order to kill a zombie you must shoot it in the head .
>2
for dance completists only .
>2
spreads itself too thin , leaving these actors , as well as the members of the commune , short of profound characterizations
>2
it would nt matter so much that this arrogant richard pryor wannabe s routine is offensive , puerile and unimaginatively foulmouthed if it was at least funny .
>2
the locale ... remains far more interesting than the story at hand .
>2
i liked the original short story but this movie , even at an hour and twentysome minutes , it s too long and it goes nowhere .
>2
this little film is so slovenly done , so primitive in technique , that it ca nt really be called animation .
>2
makes 98 minutes feel like three hours .
>2
hawke s film , a boring , pretentious waste of nearly two hours , does nt tell you anything except that the chelsea hotel today is populated by whiny , pathetic , starving and untalented artistes .
>2
aspires to the cracked lunacy of the adventures of buckaroo banzai , but thanks to an astonishingly witless script ends up more like the adventures of ford fairlane .
>2
reallife strongman ahola lacks the charisma and ability to carry the film on his admittedly broad shoulders .
>2
the title , alone , should scare any sane person away .
>2
low comedy does nt come much lower .
>2
appropriately cynical social commentary aside ,  9 never quite ignites .
>2
it s crap on a leash  far too polite to scale the lunatic heights of joe dante s similarly styled gremlins .
>2
one of the most depressing moviegoing experiences i can think of is to sit through about 90 minutes of a socalled  comedy  and not laugh once .
>2
this is the kind of movie where the big scene is a man shot out of a cannon into a vat of ice cream .
>2
a loud , brash and mainly unfunny high school comedy .
>2
an exceptionally dreary and overwrought bit of work , every bit as imperious as katzenberg s the prince of egypt from 1998 .
>2
the movie is so resolutely cobbled together out of older movies that it even uses a totally unnecessary prologue , just because it seems obligatory .
>2
the movie s vision of a white american zealously spreading a puritanical brand of christianity to south seas islanders is one only a true believer could relish .
>2
maid in manhattan proves that it s easier to change the sheets than to change hackneyed concepts when it comes to dreaming up romantic comedies .
>2
a fairly harmless but ultimately lifeless featurelength afterschool special .
>2
... the whole thing succeeded only in making me groggy .
>2
like most of jaglom s films , some of it is honestly affecting , but more of it seems contrived and secondhand .
>2
one long , numbing action sequence made up mostly of routine stuff yuen has given us before .
>2
forgettable , if goodhearted , movie .
>2
the film s most improbable feat ?
>2
... about as exciting to watch as two lastplace basketball teams playing one another on the final day of the season .
>2
the chateau ... is less concerned with cultural and political issues than doting on its eccentric characters .
>2
cruel and inhuman cinematic punishment ... simultaneously degrades its characters , its stars and its audience .
>1
it s not too fast and not too slow .
>2
it s not too much of anything .
>2
the great pity is that those responsible did nt cut their losses  and ours  and retitle it the adventures of directtovideo nash , and send it to its proper home .
>2
an empty shell of an epic rather than the real deal .
>2
instead of using george and lucy s most obvious differences to ignite sparks , lawrence desperately looks elsewhere , seizing on george s haplessness and lucy s personality tics .
>2
becomes a bit of a mishmash  a tearjerker that does nt and a thriller that wo nt .
>2
family togetherness takes a back seat to interfamily rivalry and workplace ambition ... whole subplots have no explanation or even plot relevance .
>2
grant is nt cary and bullock is nt katherine .
>2
like a fish that s lived too long , austin powers in goldmember has some unnecessary parts and is kinda wrong in places .
>1
two tedious acts light on great scares and a good surprise ending .
>2
shyamalan should stop trying to please his mom .
>2
the entire movie is in need of a scented bath .
>2
i m sorry to say that this should seal the deal  arnold is not , nor will he be , back .
>2
the story of trouble every day ... is so sketchy it amounts to little more than preliminary notes for a sciencefiction horror film , and the movie s fragmentary narrative style makes piecing the story together frustrating difficult .
>2
a movie to forget
>2
for all of its insights into the dream world of teen life , and its electronic expression through cyber culture , the film gives no quarter to anyone seeking to pull a cohesive story out of its 212  hour running time .
>2
enough is not a bad movie , just mediocre .
>2
the performances are so overstated , the effect comes off as selfparody .
>2
it looks good , but it is essentially empty .
>2
the film never finds its tone and several scenes run too long .
>2
the idea is more interesting than the screenplay , which lags badly in the middle and lurches between notveryfunny comedy , unconvincing dramatics and some lastminute action strongly reminiscent of run lola run .
>2
van wilder has a builtin audience , but only among those who are drying out from spring break and are still unconcerned about what they ingest .
>2
it s hard to believe that something so short could be so flabby .
>2
do we really need another film that praises female selfsacrifice ?
>2
the major problem with windtalkers is that the bulk of the movie centers on the wrong character .
>2
the entire point of a shaggy dog story , of course , is that it goes nowhere , and this is classic nowheresville in every sense .
>2
stale and clichd to a fault .
>2
this film is too busy hitting all of its assigned marks to take on any life of its own .
>2
watching junk like this induces a kind of abstract guilt , as if you were paying dues for good books unread , fine music never heard .
>2
starts off witty and sophisticated and you want to love it  but filmmaker yvan attal quickly writes himself into a corner .
>2
some like it hot on the hardwood proves once again that a man in drag is not in and of himself funny .
>2
witless and utterly pointless .
>2
when  science fiction  takes advantage of the fact that its intended audience has nt yet had much science , it does a disservice to the audience and to the genre .
>2
as a featurelength film , it wears out its welcome as tryingly as the title character .
>2
a sleepinducing thriller with a single twist that everyone except the characters in it can see coming a mile away .
>2
with a  spy kids  sequel opening next week , why bother with a contemptible imitator starring a  snl  hasbeen acting like an 8yearold channeling roberto benigni ?
>2
it s just rather leaden and dull .
>2
lacks the visual flair and bouncing bravado that characterizes better hiphop clips and is content to recycle images and characters that were already tired 10 years ago .
>2
statham employs an accent that i think is supposed to be an attempt at hardass american but sometimes just lapses into unhidden british .
>2
dismally dull scifi comedy .
>2
there s surely something wrong with a comedy where the only belly laughs come from the selection of outtakes tacked onto the end credits .
>1
when one hears harry shearer is going to make his debut as a film director , one would hope for the best
>2
the leads we are given here are simply too bland to be interesting .
>2
adam sandler s 8 crazy nights is 75 wasted minutes of sandler as the voiceover hero in columbia pictures  perverse idea of an animated holiday movie .
>2
essentially  fatal attraction  remade for viewers who were in diapers when the original was released in 1987 .
>2
... this story gets sillier , not scarier , as it goes along ...
>2
even a hardened voyeur would require the patience of job to get through this interminable , shapeless documentary about the swinging subculture .
>2
the film s hero is a bore and his innocence soon becomes a questionable kind of inexcusable dumb innocence .
>2
a singularly offputting romantic comedy .
>2
this is an exercise not in biography but in hero worship .
>2
it all comes down to whether you can tolerate leon barlow .
>2
in the spirit of the season , i assign one bright shining star to roberto benigni s pinocchio  but i guarantee that no wise men will be following after it .
>2
check your brain and your secret agent decoder ring at the door because you do nt want to think too much about what s going on .
>2
a culture clash comedy only half as clever as it thinks it is .
>2
the logic of it all will be greek to anyone not predisposed to the movie s rude and crude humor .
>2
starts out strongly before quickly losing its focus , point and purpose in a mess of mixed messages , overblown drama and bruce willis with a scar .
>2
... a fascinating curiosity piece  fascinating , that is , for about ten minutes .
>2
after that it becomes long and tedious like a classroom play in a college history course .
>2
director jay russell weighs down his capricious fairytale with heavy sentiment and lightweight meaning .
>2
its screenplay serves as autocritique , and its clumsiness as its own most damning censure .
>2
at times , it actually hurts to watch .
>2
nemesis suffers from a paunchy midsection , several plodding action sequences and a wickedly undramatic central theme .
>2
the jokes are telegraphed so far in advance they must have been lost in the mail .
>2
the movie is the equivalent of french hiphop , which also seems to play on a 10year delay .
>2
a beyondlame satire , teddy bears  picnic ranks among the most pitiful directing debuts by an esteemed writeractor .
>2
and people make fun of me for liking showgirls .
>2
such a wildly uneven hitandmiss enterprise , you ca nt help suspecting that it was improvised on a daytoday basis during production .
>1
a weird little movie that s amusing enough while you watch it , offering fine acting moments and pungent insights into modern l.a. s showbiz and media subcultures .
>2
but it does nt leave you with much .
>2
i m convinced i could keep a family of five blind , crippled , amish people alive in this situation better than these british soldiers do at keeping themselves kicking .
>2
like mike is a slight and uninventive movie  like the exalted michael jordan referred to in the title , many can aspire but none can equal .
>2
there is nothing funny in this everyjokehas  beentolda  thousandtimes  before movie .
>1
always destined to be measured against anthony asquith s acclaimed 1952 screen adaptation .
>2
this is standard crime drama fare ... instantly forgettable and thoroughly dull .
>2
from its nauseating spinning credits sequence to a very talented but underutilized supporting cast , bartleby squanders as much as it gives out .
>2
yet another genre exercise , gangster no. 1 is as generic as its title .
>2
there s an admirable rigor to jimmy s relentless anger , and to the script s refusal of a happy ending , but as those monologues stretch on and on , you realize there s no place for this story to go but down .
>2
a lightweight , uneven action comedy that freely mingles french , japanese and hollywood cultures .
>2
such a fine idea for a film , and such a stultifying , lifeless execution .
>2
this overlong infomercial , due out on video before month s end , is tepid and tedious .
>2
an ambitious , guiltsuffused melodrama crippled by poor casting .
>2
rarely has sex on screen been so aggressively antierotic .
>2
a dull , inconsistent , dishonest female bonding picture .
>2
so much about the film is loopy and ludicrous ... that it could have been a hoot in a badmovie way if the laborious pacing and endless exposition had been tightened .
>2
a disappointment for a movie that should have been the ultimate imax trip .
>2
this sade is hardly a perverse , dangerous libertine and agitator  which would have made for better drama .
>2
he s just a sad aristocrat in tattered finery , and the film seems as deflated as he does .
>2
the film s needlessly opaque intro takes its doeeyed crudup out of pre9  11 new york and onto a crosscountry road trip of the homeric kind .
>2
it s as if a bored cage spent the duration of the film s shooting schedule waiting to scream   got aids yet ? 
>2
the film has the throwntogether feel of a summercamp talent show  hastily written , underrehearsed , arbitrarily plotted and filled with crude humor and vulgar innuendo .
>2
the movie s messages are quite admirable , but the story is just too clichd and too often strains credulity .
>2
what we have here is nt a disaster , exactly , but a very handsomely produced letdown .
>2
the script was reportedly rewritten a dozen times  either 11 times too many or else too few .
>2
a shoddy male hip hop fantasy filled with guns , expensive cars , lots of naked women and rocawear clothing .
>2
to the filmmakers , ivan is a prince of a fellow , but he comes across as shallow and glib though not meanspirited , and there s no indication that he s been responsible for putting together any movies of particular value or merit .
>2
this is a movie filled with unlikable , spiteful idiots  whether or not their friendship is salvaged makes no difference in the least .
>2
it s as if allen , at 66 , has stopped challenging himself .
>2
scotland , pa is entirely too straightfaced to transcend its clever concept .
>2
a movie that the less charitable might describe as a castrated cross between highlander and lolita .
>2
not only does leblanc make one spectacularly uglylooking broad , but he appears miserable throughout as he swaggers through his scenes .
>2
there s little to recommend snow dogs , unless one considers cliched dialogue and perverse escapism a source of high hilarity .
>2
the film rehashes several old themes and is capped with pointless extremes  it s insanely violent and very graphic .
>2
sorority boys , which is as bad at it is cruel , takes every potential laugh and stilettostomps the life out of it .
>2
here the love scenes all end in someone screaming .
>2
maybe there s a metaphor here , but figuring it out would nt make trouble every day any better .
>2
sheridan is painfully bad , a fourthrate jim carrey who does nt understand the difference between dumb fun and just plain dumb .
>2
presents nothing special and , until the final act , nothing overtly disagreeable .
>2
the most excruciating 86 minutes one might sit through this summer that do not involve a dentist drill .
>2
was that movie nothing more than a tepid exercise in trotting out a formula that worked five years ago but has since lost its fizz ?
>2
it goes on for too long and bogs down in a surfeit of characters and unnecessary subplots .
>1
it s absolutely amazing how firsttime director kevin donovan managed to find something new to add to the canon of chan .
>2
make chan s action sequences boring .
>2
you ... get a sense of good intentions derailed by a failure to seek and strike just the right tone .
>2
 in this poor remake of such a well loved classic , parker exposes the limitations of his skill and the basic flaws in his vision . 
>2
the film s final hour , where nearly all the previous unseen material resides , is unconvincing soap opera that tornatore was right to cut .
>2
the movie does such an excellent job of critiquing itself at every faltering halfstep of its development that criticizing feels more like commiserating .
>2
i found it slow , predictable and not very amusing .
>2
director yu seems far more interested in grossout humor than in showing us wellthought stunts or a car chase that we have nt seen 10,000 times .
>2
viewers will need all the luck they can muster just figuring out who s who in this pretentious mess .
>2
get out your pooperscoopers .
>1
while the material is slight , the movie is better than you might think .
>2
it s definitely not made for kids or their parents , for that matter , and i think even fans of sandler s comic taste may find it uninteresting .
>2
sheridan seems terrified of the book s irreverent energy , and scotches most of its lan , humor , bile , and irony .
>2
more busy than exciting , more frantic than involving , more chaotic than entertaining .
>2
it s makes a better travelogue than movie .
>2
it s as if solondz had two ideas for two movies , could nt really figure out how to flesh either out , so he just slopped  em together here .
>2
its premise is smart , but the execution is pretty weary .
>2
the holiday message of the 37minute santa vs. the snowman leaves a lot to be desired .
>1
more precious than perspicacious
>2
if you saw it on tv , you d probably turn it off , convinced that you had already seen that movie .
>2
if this is cinema , i pledge allegiance to cagney and lacey .
>1
enigma looks great , has solid acting and a neat premise .
>2
yet why it fails is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma .
>2
starts promisingly but disintegrates into a dreary , humorless soap opera .
>2
perry s good and his is an interesting character , but  serving sara  has nt much more to serve than silly fluff .
>2
memorable for a peculiar malaise that renders its tension flaccid and , by extension , its surprises limp and its resolutions ritual .
>2
in the nottoodistant future , movies like ghost ship will be used as analgesic balm for overstimulated minds .
>2
right now , they re merely signposts marking the slow , lingering death of imagination .
>2
the movie s biggest shocks come from seeing former nymphette juliette lewis playing a saltoftheearth mommy named minnie and watching slim travel incognito in a ridiculous wig no respectable halloween costume shop would ever try to sell .
>2
like most movies about the pitfalls of bad behavior ... circuit gets drawn into the party .
>2
it appears as if even the filmmakers did nt know what kind of movie they were making .
>2
beneath the uncanny , inevitable and seemingly shrewd facade of moviebiz farce ... lies a plot cobbled together from largely flat and uncreative moments .
>2
piccoli s performance is amazing , yes , but the symbols of loss and denial and lifeatarm s  length in the film seem irritatingly transparent .
>2
starts out mediocre , spirals downward , and thuds to the bottom of the pool with an utterly incompetent conclusion .
>2
nicolas cage is nt the first actor to lead a group of talented friends astray , and this movie wo nt create a ruffle in what is already an erratic career .
>2
a sustained fest of selfcongratulation between actor and director that leaves scant place for the viewer .
>2
green ruins every single scene he s in , and the film , while it s not completely wreaked , is seriously compromised by that .
>2
there s not a comedic moment in this romantic comedy .
>2
the story is predictable , the jokes are typical sandler fare , and the romance with ryder is puzzling .
>2
resurrection has the dubious distinction of being a really bad imitation of the really bad blair witch project .
>2
poor ben bratt could nt find stardom if mapquest emailed him pointtopoint driving directions .
>2
pretend like your sat scores are below 120 and you might not notice the flaws .
>2
unlike trey parker , sandler does nt understand that the idea of exploiting molestation for laughs is funny , not actually exploiting it yourself .
>2
a fake street drama that keeps telling you things instead of showing them .
>2
an empty , purposeless exercise .
>2
a sometimes incisive and sensitive portrait that is undercut by its awkward structure and a final veering toward melodrama .
>2
those 24andunders looking for their own caddyshack to adopt as a generational signpost may have to keep on looking .
>2
a distinctly mixed bag , the occasional bursts of sharp writing alternating with lots of sloppiness and the obligatory moments of sentimental ooze .
>2
what begins brightly gets bogged down over 140 minutes .
>2
ahnuld s action hero days might be over .
>2
it s clear why deuces wild , which was shot two years ago , has been gathering dust on mgm s shelf .
>2
this picture is murder by numbers , and as easy to be bored by as your abc s , despite a few whopping shootouts .
>1
if you are into splatter movies , then you will probably have a reasonably good time with the salton sea .
>2
a dull , simpleminded and stereotypical tale of drugs , death and mindnumbing indifference on the innercity streets .
>2
the featurelength stretch ... strains the show s concept .
>2
this slender plot feels especially thin stretched over the nearly 80minute running time .
>2
the densest distillation of roberts  movies ever made .
>2
ultimately , the film never recovers from the clumsy clich of the ugly american abroad , and the toofrosty exterior ms. paltrow employs to authenticate her british persona is another liability .
>2
a handsome but unfulfilling suspense drama more suited to a quiet evening on pbs than a night out at an amc .
>2
master of disguise runs for only 71 minutes and feels like three hours .
>2
a reworking of die hard and cliffhanger but it s nowhere near as exciting as either .
>2
suffers from unlikable characters and a selfconscious sense of its own quirky hipness .
>2
a film without surprise geared toward maximum comfort and familiarity .
>1
fessenden continues to do interesting work , and it would be nice to see what he could make with a decent budget .
>2
but the problem with wendigo , for all its effective moments , is nt really one of resources .
>1
spirit is a visual treat , and it takes chances that are bold by studio standards , but it lacks a strong narrative .
>2
it stars schticky chris rock and stolid anthony hopkins , who seem barely in the same movie .
>2
their contrast is neither dramatic nor comic  it s just a weird fizzle .
>1
this is a children s film in the truest sense .
>1
it s packed with adventure and a worthwhile environmental message , so it s great for the kids .
>2
tykwer s surface flash is nt just a poor fit with kieslowski s lyrical pessimism  it completely contradicts everything kieslowski s work aspired to , including the condition of art .
>2
too slick and manufactured to claim street credibility .
>2
cherry orchard is badly edited , often awkwardly directed and suffers from the addition of a wholly unnecessary precredit sequence designed to give some of the characters a  back story . 
>2
what ensues are much bloodsplattering , mass druginduced bowel evacuations , and nonetoofunny commentary on the cultural distinctions between americans and brits .
>2
a dark comedy that goes for sick and demented humor simply to do so .
>2
the movie is without intent .
>2
sandra bullock and hugh grant make a great team , but this predictable romantic comedy should get a pink slip .
>2
allegiance to chekhov , which director michael cacoyannis displays with somber earnestness in the new adaptation of the cherry orchard , is a particularly vexing handicap .
>2
the first mistake , i suspect , is casting shatner as a legendary professor and kunis as a brilliant college student  where s pauly shore as the rocket scientist ?
>2
the dramatic scenes are frequently unintentionally funny , and the action sequences  clearly the main event  are surprisingly uninvolving .
>2
replacing john carpenter s stylish tracking shots is degraded , handheld blair witch videocam footage .
>2
of all the halloween s , this is the most visually unappealing .
>2
it has the requisite fauxurban vibe and hottertwoyearsago rap and rb names and references .
>2
despite its dry wit and compassion , the film suffers from a philosophical emptiness and maddeningly sedate pacing .
>2
attal pushes too hard to make this a comedy or serious drama .
>2
he seems to want both , but succeeds in making neither .
>2
i could have used my two hours better watching being john malkovich again .
>2
girlfriends are bad , wives are worse and babies are the kiss of death in this bitter italian comedy .
>2
the only young people who possibly will enjoy it are infants ... who might be distracted by the movie s quick movements and sounds .
>1
the film boasts at least a few good ideas and features some decent performances , but the result is disappointing .
>2
no such thing breaks no new ground and treads old turf like a hippopotamus ballerina .
>2
a wishywashy melodramatic movie that shows us plenty of sturm und drung , but explains its characters  decisions only unsatisfactorily .
>2
lurid and less than lucid work .
>2
a wannabe comedy of manners about a brainy prepschool kid with a mrs. robinson complex founders on its own preciousness  and squanders its beautiful women .
>1
if anything , see it for karen black , who camps up a storm as a fringe feminist conspiracy theorist named dirty dick .
>2
this 90minute dud could pass for mike tyson s e !
>2
this is surely one of the most frantic , virulent and foulnatured christmas season pics ever delivered by a hollywood studio .
>2
once the expectation of laughter has been quashed by whatever obscenity is at hand , even the funniest idea is nt funny .
>2
the connected stories of breitbart and hanussen are actually fascinating , but the filmmaking in invincible is such that the movie does not do them justice .
>2
a depressingly retrograde ,  postfeminist  romantic comedy that takes an astonishingly condescending attitude toward women .
>1
just bring on the battle bots , please !
>2
while it s all quite tasteful to look at , the attention process tends to do a little fleeing of its own .
>2
broder s screenplay is shallow , offensive and redundant , with pitifully few real laughs .
>2
the sweetest thing leaves a bitter taste .
>2
in a big corner office in hell , satan is throwing up his hands in surrender , is firing his rd people , and has decided he will just screen the master of disguise 247 .
>2
a thriller without a lot of thrills .
>2
this stuck pig of a movie flails limply between bizarre comedy and pallid horror .
>2
done in mostly by a weak script that ca nt support the epic treatment .
>2
despite its visual virtuosity ,  naqoyqatsi  is banal in its message and the choice of material to convey it .
>2
slap her  she s not funny !
>2
no french people were harmed during the making of this movie , but they were insulted and the audience was put through torture for an hour and a half .
>1
though its rather routine script is loaded with familiar situations , the movie has a cinematic fluidity and sense of intelligence that makes it work more than it probably should .
>2
 one look at a girl in tight pants and big tits and you turn stupid ? 
>2
um ... is nt that the basis for the entire plot ?
>1
one regards reign of fire with awe .
>2
its impressive images of crematorium chimney fires and stacks of dead bodies are undermined by the movie s presentation , which is way too stagy .
>1
seeing as the film lacks momentum and its position remains mostly undeterminable , the director s experiment is a successful one .
>2
i suspect this is the kind of production that would have been funnier if the director had released the outtakes theatrically and used the film as a bonus feature on the dvd .
>2
an unfortunate title for a film that has nothing endearing about it .
>2
can be as tiresome as 9 seconds of jesse helms  anti castro rhetoric , which are included
>2
comes off as a long , laborious whine , the bellyaching of a paranoid and unlikable man .
>2
it just goes to show , an intelligent person is nt necessarily an admirable storyteller .
>2
... most viewers will wish there had been more of the  queen  and less of the  damned . 
>2
hopelessly inane , humorless and underinspired .
>2
it reduces the complexities to bromides and slogans and it gets so preachykeen and so tubthumpingly loud it makes you feel like a chump just for sitting through it .
>2
the problem with  xxx  is that its own action is nt very effective .
>2
a great script brought down by lousy direction .
>2
big mistake .
>2
a mediocre exercise in target demographics , unaware that it s the butt of its own joke .
>2
he does nt , however , deliver nearly enough of the show s trademark style and flash .
>2
perhaps even the slc high command found writerdirector mitch davis s wall of kitsch hard going .
>1
according to wendigo ,  nature  loves the members of the upper class almost as much as they love themselves .
>1
an encouraging effort from mccrudden
>2
the romance between the leads is nt as compelling or as believable as it should be .
>2
if i could have looked into my future and saw how bad this movie was , i would go back and choose to skip it .
>2
supposedly authentic account of a historical event that s far too tragic to merit such superficial treatment .
>2
adroit but finally a trifle flat , mad love does nt galvanize its outrage the way , say , jane campion might have done , but at least it possesses some .
>2
to blandly go where we went 8 movies ago ...
>2
a slowmoving policeprocedural thriller that takes its title all too literally .
>2
this uboat does nt have a captain .
>2
this one aims for the toilet and scores a direct hit .
>2
dull , a roadtrip movie that s surprisingly short of both adventure and song .
>2
i walked away not really know who  they  were , what  they  looked like .
>2
why  they  were here and what  they  wanted and quite honestly , i did nt care .
>2
after several scenes of this tacky nonsense , you ll be wistful for the testosteronecharged wizardry of jerry bruckheimer productions , especially because half past dead is like the rock on a walmart budget .
>2
the country bears wastes an exceptionally good idea .
>2
but the movie that does nt really deliver for country music fans or for family audiences
>2
as for children , they wo nt enjoy the movie at all .
>2
... you can be forgiven for realizing that you ve spent the past 20 minutes looking at your watch and waiting for frida to just die already .
>2
too bad writerdirector adam rifkin situates it all in a plot as musty as one of the golden eagle s carpets .
>2
it s lazy for a movie to avoid solving one problem by trying to distract us with the solution to another .
>2
the movie is genial but never inspired , and little about it will stay with you .
>2
but its storytelling prowess and special effects are both listless .
>2
despite the opulent lushness of every scene , the characters never seem to match the power of their surroundings .
>2
even after 90 minutes of playing opposite each other bullock and grant still look ill at ease sharing the same scene .
>2
what should have been a painless timekiller becomes instead a grating endurance test .
>2
a bland , obnoxious 88minute infomercial for universal studios and its ancillary products . . .
>2
little action , almost no suspense or believable tension , onedimensional characters up the wazoo and sets that can only be described as scifi generic .
>2
the master of disguise is awful .
>2
it s pauly shore awful .
>2
do nt say you were nt warned .
>2
disappointing in comparison to other recent war movies ... or any other john woo flick for that matter .
>2
 opening up  the play more has partly closed it down .
>2
an ugly , revolting movie .
>2
the film is way too full of itself  it s stuffy and pretentious in a givemeanoscar kind of way .
>2
the movie is concocted and carried out by folks worthy of scorn , and the nicest thing i can say is that i ca nt remember a single name responsible for it .
>2
watching  ending  is too often like looking over the outdated clothes and plastic knickknacks at your neighbor s garage sale .
>2
you ca nt believe anyone would really buy this stuff .
>2
it desperately wants to be a wacky , screwball comedy , but the most screwy thing here is how so many talented people were convinced to waste their time .
>2
the skills of a calculus major at m.i.t. are required to balance all the formulaic equations in the longwinded heist comedy who is cletis tout ?
>2
from the choppy editing to the annoying score to  special effects  by way of replacing objects in a character s hands below the camera line ,  besotted  is misbegotten
>2
my advice is to skip the film and pick up the soundtrack .
>2
filled with lowbrow humor , gratuitous violence and a disturbing disregard for life .
>2
an unsophisticated scifi drama that takes itself all too seriously .
>2
solondz is without doubt an artist of uncompromising vision , but that vision is beginning to feel , if not morally bankrupt , at least terribly monotonous .
>2
alas , getting there is not even half the interest .
>2
deuces wild treads heavily into romeo and julietwest side story territory , where it plainly has no business going .
>2
hart s war seems to want to be a character study , but apparently ca nt quite decide which character .
>2
theological matters aside , the movie is so clumsily sentimental and ineptly directed it may leave you speaking in tongues .
>2
this latest installment of the horror film franchise that is apparently as invulnerable as its trademark villain has arrived for an incongruous summer playoff , demonstrating yet again that the era of the intelligent , wellmade b movie is long gone .
>2
novak contemplates a heartland so overwhelmed by its lack of purpose that it seeks excitement in manufactured high drama .
>2
been there , done that , liked it much better the first time around  when it was called the professional .
>2
the film is all over the place , really .
>2
it dabbles all around , never gaining much momentum .
>2
the action quickly sinks into bythenumbers territory .
>2
forages for audience sympathy like a temperamental child begging for attention , giving audiences no reason to truly care for its decrepit freaks beyond the promise of a reprieve from their incessant whining .
>2
such a premise is ripe for all manner of lunacy , but kaufman and gondry rarely seem sure of where it should go .
>2
burns  fifth beersoaked film feels in almost every possible way  from the writing and direction to the soggy performances  tossed off .
>2
while this one gets off with a good natured warning , future lizard endeavors will need to adhere more closely to the laws of laughter
>2
another boorish movie from the iheardajoke  atafratparty school of screenwriting .
>2
too much of the movie feels contrived , as if the filmmakers were worried the story would nt work without all those gimmicks .
>2
it s hard to understand why anyone in his right mind would even think to make the attraction a movie .
>2
and it s harder still to believe that anyone in his right mind would want to see the it .
>2
the ethos of the chelsea hotel may shape hawke s artistic aspirations , but he has nt yet coordinated his own dv poetry with the beat he hears in his soul .
>2
why sit through a crummy , wannabehip crime comedy that refers incessantly to old movies , when you could just rent those movies instead , let alone seek out a respectable new one ?
>2
the obnoxious special effects , the obligatory outbursts of flatulence and the incessant , sofiveminutesago pop music on the soundtrack overwhelm what is left of the scruffy , dopey old hannabarbera charm .
>2
the movie s downfall is to substitute plot for personality .
>2
it does nt really know or care about the characters , and uses them as markers for a series of preordained events .
>2
all mood and no movie .
>2
press the delete key .
>1
simone is not a bad film .
>2
it just does nt have anything really interesting to say .
>2
once he starts learning to compromise with reality enough to become comparatively sane and healthy , the film becomes predictably conventional .
>2
wait to see it then .
>2
there s no disguising this as one of the worst films of the summer .
>2
lacks the spirit of the previous two , and makes all those jokes about hos and even more unmentionable subjects seem like mere splashing around in the muck .
>2
this hastily mounted production exists only to capitalize on hopkins  inclination to play hannibal lecter again , even though harris has no immediate inclination to provide a fourth book .
>2
death to smoochy tells a moldyoldie , notnearly  asnasty  asit  thinksitis joke .
>2
over and over again .
>2
the threat implied in the title pokmon 4ever is terrifying  like locusts in a horde these things will keep coming .
>2
the film never gets over its own investment in conventional arrangements , in terms of love , age , gender , race , and class .
>2
to call this film a lump of coal would only be to flatter it .
>2
the film falls short on tension , eloquence , spiritual challenge  things that have made the original new testament stories so compelling for 20 centuries .
>1
by the end of it all i sort of loved the people onscreen , even though i could not stand them .
>2
it s not an easy one to review .
>2
at best this is a film for the under7 crowd .
>2
but it would be better to wait for the video .
>2
the whole talkinganimal thing is grisly .
>1
never again , while nothing special , is pleasant , diverting and modest  definitely a step in the right direction .
>2
but here s a movie about it anyway .
>2
the punch lines that miss , unfortunately , outnumber the hits by threetoone .
>1
those who trek to the  plex predisposed to like it probably will enjoy themselves .
>2
but ticketbuyers with great expectations will wind up as glum as mr. de niro .
>2
a determined , ennuihobbled slog that really does nt have much to say beyond the news flash that loneliness can make people act weird .
>1
too daft by half ... but supremely good natured .
>2
fails in making this character understandable , in getting under her skin , in exploring motivation ... well before the end , the film grows as dull as its characters , about whose fate it is hard to care .
>2
it s a shame that the storyline and its underlying themes ... finally seem so impersonal or even shallow .
>2
woody , what happened ?
>1
juliette binoche s sand is vivacious , but it s hard to sense that powerhouse of 19thcentury prose behind her childlike smile .
>2
it s supposed to be postfeminist breezy but ends up as tedious as the chatter of parrots raised on oprah .
>2
you can tell almost immediately that welcome to collinwood is nt going to jell .
>2
throughout all the tumult , a question comes to mind  so why is this so boring ?
>2
cattaneo reworks the formula that made the full monty a smashing success ... but neglects to add the magic that made it all work .
>2
totally overwrought , deeply biased , and wholly designed to make you feel guilty about ignoring what the filmmakers clearly believe are the greatest musicians of all time .
>2
you can practically hear george orwell turning over .
>2
behan s memoir is great material for a film  rowdy , brawny and lyrical in the best irish sense  but sheridan has settled for a lugubrious romance .
>2
lazy filmmaking , with the director taking a handsoff approach when he should have shaped the story to show us why it s compelling .
>2
if it were any more of a turkey , it would gobble in dolby digital stereo .
>2
if nothing else ,  rollerball  2002 may go down in cinema history as the only movie ever in which the rest of the cast was outshined by ll cool j.
>2
how do you make a movie with depth about a man who lacked any ?
>2
on the evidence before us , the answer is clear  not easily and , in the end , not well enough .
>2
the film s trailer also looked like crap , so crap is what i was expecting .
>2
more trifle than triumph .
>2
the movie is almost completely lacking in suspense , surprise and consistent emotional conviction .
>2
festers in just such a dungpile that you d swear you were watching monkeys flinging their feces at you .
>2
lyne s latest , the erotic thriller unfaithful , further demonstrates just how far his storytelling skills have eroded .
>2
it sounds like another clever if pointless excursion into the abyss , and that s more or less how it plays out .
>2
rumor , a muddled drama about coming to terms with death , feels impersonal , almost generic .
>2
report card  does nt live up to the exalted tagline  there s definite room for improvement .
>2
the pacing is deadly , the narration helps little and naipaul , a juicy writer , is negated .
>1
maybe he was reading the minds of the audience .
>2
... if it had been only halfanhour long or a tv special , the humor would have been fast and furious  at ninety minutes , it drags .
>2
bean drops the ball too many times ... hoping the nifty premise will create enough interest to make up for an unfocused screenplay .
>2
blood work is laughable in the solemnity with which it tries to pump life into overworked elements from eastwood s dirty harry period .
>2
the movie is too amateurishly square to make the most of its own ironic implications .
>1
and lee seems just as expectant of an adoring , widesmiling reception .
>2
there s not one decent performance from the cast and not one clever line of dialogue .
>2
no amount of burning , blasting , stabbing , and shooting can hide a weak script .
>2
it s an odd show , pregnant with moods , stillborn except as a harsh conceptual exercise .
>2
nearly all the fundamentals you take for granted in most films are mishandled here .
>2
earnest yet curiously tepid and choppy recycling in which predictability is the only winner .
>1
the exploitative , clumsily staged violence overshadows everything , including most of the actors .
>2
we started to wonder if ... some unpaid intern had just typed  chris rock ,   anthony hopkins  and  terrorists  into some univaclike script machine .
>2
even when crush departs from the 4w formula ... it feels like a glossy rehash .
>2
more likely to have you scratching your head than hiding under your seat .
>2
bears is even worse than i imagined a movie ever could be .
>2
when you find yourself rooting for the monsters in a horror movie , you know the picture is in trouble .
>2
this is very much of a mixed bag , with enough negatives to outweigh the positives .
>2
marinated in clichs and mawkish dialogue .
>2
whether it s the worst movie of 2002 , i ca nt say for sure  memories of rollerball have faded , and i skipped country bears .
>2
but this new jangle of noise , mayhem and stupidity must be a serious contender for the title .
>2
not once in the rush to save the day did i become very involved in the proceedings  to me , it was just a matter of  eh . 
>2
rollerball is as bad as you think , and worse than you can imagine .
>2
the first question to ask about bad company is why anthony hopkins is in it .
>2
we assume he had a bad run in the market or a costly divorce , because there is no earthly reason other than money why this distinguished actor would stoop so low .
>2
not exaggerated enough to be a parody of grossout flicks , college flicks , or even flicks in general .
>2
it merely indulges in the worst elements of all of them .
>2
shame on writerdirector vicente aranda for making a florid biopic about mad queens , obsessive relationships , and rampant adultery so dull .
>2
violent , vulgar and forgettably entertaining .
>2
nothing happens , and it happens to flat characters .
>2
with a completely predictable plot , you ll swear that you ve seen it all before , even if you ve never come within a mile of the longest yard .
>2
remember back when thrillers actually thrilled ?
>2
sadly , as blood work proves , that was a long , long time ago .
>2
blue crush has all the trappings of an energetic , extremesports adventure , but ends up more of a creaky  pretty woman  retread , with the emphasis on selfempowering schmaltz and bigwave surfing that gives pic its title an afterthought .
>2
this movie plays like an extended dialogue exercise in retard 101 .
>2
what we get in feardotcom is more like something from a bad clive barker movie .
>2
in other words , it s badder than bad .
>2
if they broke out into elaborate choreography , singing and finger snapping it might have held my attention , but as it stands i kept looking for the last exit from brooklyn .
>2
a sloppy slapstick throwback to long gone bottomofthebill fare like the ghost and mr. chicken .
>2
a small independent film suffering from a severe case of hollywooditis .
>2
where the film falters is in its tone .
>2
the story alone could force you to scratch a hole in your head .
>2
ultimately , sarah s dedication to finding her husband seems more psychotic than romantic , and nothing in the movie makes a convincing case that one woman s broken heart outweighs all the loss we witness .
>2
feels more like a rejected xfiles episode than a credible account of a puzzling reallife happening .
>2
men in black ii achieves ultimate insignificance  it s the scifi comedy spectacle as whiffleball epic .
>2
a zombie movie in every sense of the word  mindless , lifeless , meandering , loud , painful , obnoxious .
>2
it does nt take a rocket scientist to figure out that this is a mormon family movie , and a sappy , preachy one at that .
>1
definitely a crowdpleaser , but then , so was the roman colosseum .
>2
although it starts off so bad that you feel like running out screaming , it eventually works its way up to merely bad rather than painfully awful .
>2
the result is so tame that even slightly wisedup kids would quickly change the channel .
>2
it appears to have been modeled on the worst revengeofthenerds clichs the filmmakers could dredge up .
>2
nothing but an episode of smackdown !
>2
while the story is betterfocused than the incomprehensible anne rice novel it s based upon , queen of the damned is a pointless , meandering celebration of the gothvampire , tortured woeisme lifestyle .
>2
it should be interesting , it should be poignant , it turns out to be affected and boring .
>2
a tired , predictable , bordering on offensive , waste of time , money and celluloid .
>2
stealing harvard will dip into your wallet , swipe 90 minutes of your time , and offer you precisely this in recompense  a few early laughs scattered around a plot as thin as it is repetitious .
>2
this is an insultingly inept and artificial examination of grief and its impacts upon the relationships of the survivors .
>2
 martin lawrence live  is so selfpitying , i almost expected there to be a collection taken for the comedian at the end of the show .
>2
the dialogue is cumbersome , the simpering soundtrack and editing more so .
>2
never decides whether it wants to be a black comedy , drama , melodrama or some combination of the three .
>2
it has become apparent that the franchise s best years are long past .
>2
hate it because it s lousy .
>2
... better described as a ghost story gone badly awry .
>2
like a bad improvisation exercise , the superficially written characters ramble on tediously about their lives , loves and the art they re struggling to create .
>2
the filmmakers are playing to the big boys in new york and l.a. to that end , they mock the kind of folks they do nt understand , ones they figure the powerlunchers do nt care to understand , either .
>1
competently directed but terminally cute drama .
>2
the big finish is a bit like getting all excited about a chocolate eclair and then biting into it and finding the filling missing .
>2
not just unlikable .
>2
disturbing .
>2
disgusting .
>2
without any redeeming value whatsoever .
>2
this thing is virtually unwatchable .
>1
those eternally devoted to the insanity of black will have an intermittently good time .
>2
feel free to go get popcorn whenever he s not onscreen .
>2
the selfserious equilibrium makes its point too well  a movie , like life , is nt much fun without the highs and lows .
>1
the work of an exhausted , desiccated talent who ca nt get out of his own way .
>2
the main characters are simply named the husband , the wife and the kidnapper , emphasizing the disappointingly generic nature of the entire effort .
>2
in terms of execution this movie is careless and unfocused .
>2
swims in mediocrity , sticking its head up for a breath of fresh air now and then .
>2
the only type of lives this glossy comedydrama resembles are ones in formulaic mainstream movies .
>2
the characters ... are paperthin , and their personalities undergo radical changes when it suits the script .
>2
the trouble is , its filmmakers run out of clever ideas and visual gags about halfway through .
>2
 spy action flick with antonio banderas and lucy liu never comes together .
>2
a soso , madefortv something posing as a real movie .
>2
whether this is art imitating life or life imitating art , it s an unhappy situation all around .
>2
an uneasy mix of runofthemill raunchy humor and seemingly sincere personal reflection .
>1
a formula family tearjerker told with a heavy irish brogue ... accentuating , rather than muting , the plot s saccharine thrust .
>2
this is sandler running on empty , repeating what he s already done way too often .
>2
this is as lax and limp a comedy as i ve seen in a while , a meander through wornout material .
>2
time literally stops on a dime in the triessohardtobecool  clockstoppers ,  but that does nt mean it still wo nt feel like the longest 90 minutes of your moviegoing life .
>2
aptly named , this shimmering , beautifully costumed and filmed production does nt work for me .
>2
has none of the crackle of  fatal attraction  ,  9 12 weeks  , or even  indecent proposal  , and feels more like lyne s stolid remake of  lolita  .
>2
a rehash of every gangster movie from the past decade .
>2
gaping plot holes sink this  sub   standard thriller and drag audience enthusiasm to crush depth .
>2
talkiness is nt necessarily bad , but the dialogue frequently misses the mark .
>1
the stunt work is topnotch  the dialogue and drama often foodspittingly funny .
>2
the movie is nt painfully bad , something to be  fully experienced   it s just tediously bad , something to be fully forgotten .
>2
charly comes off as emotionally manipulative and sadly imitative of innumerable past love story derisions .
>2
what a great shame that such a talented director as chen kaige has chosen to make his englishlanguage debut with a film so poorly plotted and scripted .
>2
no amount of good intentions is able to overcome the triviality of the story .
>1
the film ... presents classic moralcondundrum drama  what would you have done to survive ?
>2
the problem with the film is whether these ambitions , laudable in themselves , justify a theatrical simulation of the death camp of auschwitz iibirkenau .
>2
... for all its social and political potential , state property does nt end up being very inspiring or insightful .
>2
a film really has to be exceptional to justify a three hour running time , and this is nt .
>2
little more than a stylish exercise in revisionism whose point ... is no doubt true , but serves as a rather thin moral to such a knowing fable .
>2
the nonstop artifice ultimately proves tiresome , with the surface histrionics failing to compensate for the paperthin characterizations and facile situations .
>2
this is a monumental achievement in practically every facet of inept filmmaking  joyless , idiotic , annoying , heavyhanded , visually atrocious , and often downright creepy .
>2
overburdened with complicated plotting and banal dialogue
>2
the master of disguise falls under the category of  should have been a sketch on saturday night live . 
>2
yet another selfconsciously overwritten story about a ragtag bunch of wouldbe characters that team up for a ca nt  miss heist  only to have it all go wrong .
>2
koepp s screenplay is nt nearly surprising or clever enough to sustain a reasonable degree of suspense on its own .
>2
is it really an advantage to invest such subtlety and warmth in an animatronic bear when the humans are acting like puppets ?
>2
more successful at relating history than in creating an emotionally complex , dramatically satisfying heroine
>2
clumsy , obvious , preposterous , the movie will likely set the cause of woman warriors back decades .
>2
it s hard to pity the  plain  girl who becomes a ravishing waif after applying a smear of lipgloss .
>2
rather , pity anyone who sees this mishmash .
>2
a banal , virulently unpleasant excuse for a romantic comedy .
>2
the drama discloses almost nothing .
>2
a minorleague soccer remake of the longest yard .
>2
belongs in the toohotfortv directtovideodvd category , and this is why i have given it a onestar rating .
>2
as earnest as a communitycollege advertisement , american chai is enough to make you put away the guitar , sell the amp , and apply to medical school .
>2
a dimwitted and lazy spinoff of the animal planet documentary series , crocodile hunter is entertainment opportunism at its most glaring .
>2
even fans of ismail merchant s work , i suspect , would have a hard time sitting through this one .
>1
the world needs more filmmakers with passionate enthusiasms like martin scorsese .
>2
sade achieves the nearimpossible  it turns the marquis de sade into a dullard .
>2
one of the most plain , unimaginative romantic comedies i ve ever seen .
>2
though there s a clarity of purpose and evenhandedness to the film s direction , the drama feels rigged and sluggish .
>2
unfortunately , the experience of actually watching the movie is less compelling than the circumstances of its making .
>2
unless there are zoning ordinances to protect your community from the dullest science fiction , impostor is opening today at a theater near you .
>2
it should be doing a lot of things , but does nt .
>2
chen films the resolutely downbeat smokers only with every indulgent , indie trick in the book .
>2
... a rather bland affair .
>2
soulless and  even more damning  virtually joyless , xxx achieves near virtuosity in its crapulence .
>2
a boring masquerade ball where normally good actors , even kingsley , are made to look bad .
>2
all the queen s men is a throwback war movie that fails on so many levels , it should pay reparations to viewers .
>2
the filmmakers keep pushing the jokes at the expense of character until things fall apart .
>2
rather than real figures , elling and kjell bjarne become symbolic characters whose actions are supposed to relate something about the naf s encounter with the world .
>1
mariah carey gives us another peek at some of the magic we saw in glitter here in wisegirls .
>2
it s all arty and jazzy and people sit and stare and turn away from one another instead of talking and it s all about the silences and if you re into that , have at it .
>2
i suspect that you ll be as bored watching morvern callar as the characters are in it .
>2
if you go , pack your knitting needles .
>2
the lead actors share no chemistry or engaging charisma .
>2
we do nt even like their characters .
>2
some writer dude , i think his name was , uh , michael zaidan , was supposed to have like written the screenplay or something , but , dude , the only thing that i ever saw that was written down were the zeroes on my paycheck .
>2
the movie does nt generate a lot of energy .
>2
it is dark , brooding and slow , and takes its central idea way too seriously .
>2
this feature is about as necessary as a hole in the head
>2
spectators will indeed sit openmouthed before the screen , not screaming but yawning .
>2
it feels like very light errol morris , focusing on eccentricity but failing , ultimately , to make something bigger out of its scrapbook of oddballs .
>2
a period story about a catholic boy who tries to help a jewish friend get into heaven by sending the audience straight to hell .
>2
the premise itself is just sooooo tired .
>2
pair that with really poor comedic writing ... and you ve got a huge mess .
>2
proves a lovely trifle that , unfortunately , is a little too in love with its own cuteness .
>2
did we really need a remake of  charade ? 
>2
stealing harvard ca nt even do that much .
>2
each scene immediately succumbs to gravity and plummets to earth .
>2
the only fun part of the movie is playing the obvious game .
>2
you try to guess the order in which the kids in the house will be gored .
>2
i spied with my little eye ... a mediocre collection of cookiecutter action scenes and occasionally inspired dialogue bits
>2
entertains not so much because of its music or comic antics , but through the perverse pleasure of watching disney scrape the bottom of its own cracker barrel .
>2
the satire is just too easy to be genuinely satisfying .
>2
less funny than it should be and less funny than it thinks it is .
>1
 style crosscountry adventure ... it has sporadic bursts of liveliness , some soso slapstick and a few earpleasing songs on its soundtrack .
>2
a feeble tootsie knockoff .
>2
an awful movie that will only satisfy the most emotionally malleable of filmgoers .
>2
... the story is farflung , illogical , and plain stupid .
>2
the very simple story seems too simple and the working out of the plot almost arbitrary .
>2
an allegory concerning the chronically mixed signals african american professionals get about overachieving could be intriguing , but the supernatural trappings only obscure the message .
>2
one key problem with these ardently christian storylines is that there is never any question of how things will turn out .
>2
a relentless , bombastic and ultimately empty world war ii action flick .
>2
too long , and larded with exposition , this somber cop drama ultimately feels as flat as the scruffy sands of its titular community .
>2
leaves viewers out in the cold and undermines some phenomenal performances .
>2
swiftly deteriorates into a terribly obvious melodrama and roughhewn vanity project for lead actress andie macdowell .
>2
the histrionic muse still eludes madonna and , playing a charmless witch , she is merely a charmless witch .
>2
you have no affinity for most of the characters .
>2
nothing about them is attractive .
>2
what they see in each other also is difficult to fathom .
>1
diaz , applegate , blair and posey are suitably kooky which should appeal to women and they strip down often enough to keep men alert , if not amused .
>2
an inept , tedious spoof of 70s kung fu pictures , it contains almost enough chuckles for a threeminute sketch , and no more .
>2
it s a mystery how the movie could be released in this condition .
>2
eight legged freaks falls flat as a spoof .
>2
no matter how much he runs around and acts like a doofus , accepting a 50yearold in the role is creepy in a michael jackson sort of way .
>2
you ll just have your head in your hands wondering why lee s character did nt just go to a bank manager and save everyone the misery .
>2
 dragonfly  dwells on crossingover mumbo jumbo , manipulative sentimentality , and sappy dialogue .
>2
veers uncomfortably close to proserb propaganda .
>2
movies like high crimes flog the dead horse of surprise as if it were an obligation .
>2
how about surprising us by trying something new ?
>2
final verdict  you ve seen it all before .
>2
throwing in everything except someone pulling the pin from a grenade with his teeth , windtalkers seems to have ransacked every old world war ii movie for overly familiar material .
>2
further sad evidence that tom tykwer , director of the resonant and sensespinning run lola run , has turned out to be a onetrick pony  a maker of softheaded metaphysical claptrap .
>2
you ll trudge out of the theater feeling as though you rode the zipper after eating a corn dog and an extralarge cotton candy .
>2
the movie is a little tired  maybe the original inspiration has run its course .
>2
a fullfrontal attack on audience patience .
>2
it s a big idea , but the film itself is small and shriveled .
>2
debut effort by  project greenlight  winner is sappy and amateurish .
>2
too bad none of it is funny .
>2
the film , like jimmy s routines , could use a few good laughs .
>2
purports to be a hollywood satire but winds up as the kind of film that should be the target of something deeper and more engaging .
>1
oh , and more entertaining , too .
>2
... in the pile of useless actioners from mtv schmucks who do nt know how to tell a story for more than four minutes .
>2
humor in i spy is so anemic .
>2
the film is strictly routine .
>2
in addition to sporting one of the worst titles in recent cinematic history , ballistic  ecks vs. sever also features terrible , banal dialogue  convenient , holeridden plotting  superficial characters and a rather dull , unimaginative car chase .
>2
you can not guess why the cast and crew did nt sign a pact to burn the negative and the script and pretend the whole thing never existed .
>2
barney throws away the goodwill the first half of his movie generates by orchestrating a finale that is impenetrable and dull .
>2
we get the comedy we settle for .
>2
the uneven movie does have its charms and its funny moments but not quite enough of them .
>2
a word of advice to the makers of the singles ward  celebrity cameos do not automatically equal laughs .
>2
and neither do cliches , no matter how  inside  they are .
>1
the campy results make mel brooks  borscht belt schtick look sophisticated .
>2
its appeal will probably limited to lds church members and undemanding armchair tourists .
>2
the hanukkah spirit seems fried in pork .
>2
cherish would ve worked a lot better had it been a short film .
>2
manipulative claptrap , a periodpiece movieoftheweek , plain old blarney ... take your pick .
>2
all three descriptions suit evelyn , a besotted and obvious drama that tells us nothing new .
>1
still , the updated dickensian sensibility of writer craig bartlett s story is appealing .
>2
true to its title , it traps audiences in a series of relentlessly nasty situations that we would pay a considerable ransom not to be looking at .
>2
does nt come close to justifying the hype that surrounded its debut at the sundance film festival two years ago .
>2
the plot is paperthin and the characters are nt interesting enough to watch them go about their daily activities for two whole hours .
>2
kaufman s script is never especially clever and often is rather pretentious .
>2
queen of the damned is too long with too little going on .
>2
it collapses when mr. taylor tries to shift the tone to a thriller s rush .
>2
any film that does nt even in passing mention political prisoners , poverty and the boat loads of people who try to escape the country is less a documentary and more propaganda by way of a valentine sealed with a kiss .
>2
... blade ii is still topheavy with blazing guns , cheatfully filmed martial arts , disintegrating bloodsucker computer effects and jagged camera moves that serve no other purpose than to call attention to themselves .
>2
the rules of attraction gets us too drunk on the party favors to sober us up with the transparent attempts at moralizing .
>2
though there are many tense scenes in trapped , they prove more distressing than suspenseful .
>2
feels strangely hollow at its emotional core .
>2
the highconcept scenario soon proves preposterous , the acting is robotically italicized , and truthinadvertising hounds take note  there s very little hustling on view .
>2
this director s cut  which adds 51 minutes  takes a great film and turns it into a mundane soap opera .
>2
characterisation has been sacrificed for the sake of spectacle .
>2
that s muy loco , but no more ridiculous than most of the rest of  dragonfly . 
>2
it s a movie that ends with truckzilla , for cryin  out loud .
>2
if that does nt clue you in that something s horribly wrong , nothing will .
>2
director tom shadyac and star kevin costner glumly mishandle the story s promising premise of a physician who needs to heal himself .
>2
it s difficult to imagine that a more confused , less interesting and more sloppily made film could possibly come down the road in 2002 .
>2
like the tuck family themselves , this movie just goes on and on and on and on
>2
as pedestrian as they come .
>2
a film that plays things so nice n safe as to often play like a milquetoast movie of the week blown up for the big screen .
>2
it s a feelbad ending for a depressing story that throws a bunch of hotbutton items in the viewer s face and asks to be seen as hip , winking social commentary .
>2
more intellectually scary than dramatically involving .
>2
an inconsequential , barely there bit of piffle .
>2

as saccharine as it is disposable .
>2
you come away thinking not only that kate is nt very bright , but that she has nt been worth caring about and that maybe she , janine and molly  an allwoman dysfunctional family  deserve one another .
>2
the metaphors are provocative , but too often , the viewer is left puzzled by the mechanics of the delivery .

very much a home video , and so devoid of artifice and purpose that it appears not to have been edited at all .
>2
too much power , not enough puff .
>2
the attempt to build up a pressure cooker of horrified awe emerges from the simple fact that the movie has virtually nothing to show .
>2
it s provocative stuff , but the speculative effort is hampered by taylor s cartoonish performance and the film s illconsidered notion that hitler s destiny was shaped by the most random of chances .
>2
a cellophanepop remake of the punk classic ladies and gentlemen , the fabulous stains ... crossroads is never much worse than bland or better than inconsequential .
>2
for this sort of thing to work , we need agile performers , but the proficient , dull sorvino has no light touch , and rodan is out of his league .
>2
narc is all menace and atmosphere .
>2
despite juliet stevenon s attempt to bring cohesion to pamela s emotional roller coaster life , it is not enough to give the film the substance it so desperately needs .
>2
it s tough to be startled when you re almost dozing .
>2
it s so downbeat and nearly humorless that it becomes a chore to sit through  despite some firstrate performances by its lead .
>2
a terrible movie that some people will nevertheless find moving .
>2
there are many definitions of  time waster  but this movie must surely be one of them .

as it stands , crocodile hunter has the hurried , badly cobbled look of the 1959 godzilla , which combined scenes of a japanese monster flick with canned shots of raymond burr commenting on the monster s path of destruction .
>2
enigma is wellmade , but it s just too dry and too placid .
>1
 sweet home alabama  is what it is  a nice , harmless date film ...
>1
the dangerous lives of altar boys  take on adolescence feels painfully true .
>1
it s a masterpiece .
>2
they crush each other under cars , throw each other out windows , electrocute and dismember their victims in full consciousness .
>1
and we do nt avert our eyes for a moment .
>1
third time s the charm ... yeah , baby !

 stock up on silver bullets for director neil marshall s intense freight train of a film .

catch it ... if you can !
>2
american and european cinema has amassed a vast holocaust literature , but it is impossible to think of any film more challenging or depressing than the grey zone .
>1
 possession ,  based on the book by a.s. byatt , demands that labute deal with the subject of love headon  trading in his cynicism for reverence and a little wit
>1
it s the kind of movie that , aside from robert altman , spike lee , the coen brothers and a few others , our moviemakers do nt make often enough .
>1
alternates between deadpan comedy and heartbreaking loneliness and is nt afraid to provoke introspection in both its characters and its audience .
>1
the script is smart , not cloying .
>1
visually ,  santa clause 2  is wondrously creative .
>1
a bittersweet contemporary comedy about benevolent deception , which , while it may not rival the filmmaker s period pieces , is still very much worth seeing .
>1
an ambitious  what if ? 
>1
that works .
>1
 the dangerous lives of altar boys  has flaws , but it also has humor and heart and very talented young actors
>1
nice piece of work .
>1
 stock up on silver bullets for director neil marshall s intense freight train of a film . 
>1
it s funny , as the old saying goes , because it s true .
>1
though the film is static , its writerdirector s heart is in the right place , his plea for democracy and civic action laudable .
>1
from blushing to gushing  imamura squirts the screen in  warm water under a red bridge 
>1
apart from anything else , this is one of the bestsustained ideas i have ever seen on the screen .
>1
not a schlocky creature feature but something far more stylish and cerebral  and , hence , more chillingly effective .
>2
stupid , infantile , redundant , sloppy , overthetop , and amateurish .
>2
go back to sleep .
>2
i did nt laugh .
>2
i did nt smile .
>2
the worst film of the year .
>2
in the bookontape market , the film of  the kid stays in the picture  would be an abridged edition
>2
a sour attempt at making a farrelly brothersstyle , downanddirty laugher for the female set .
>2
eisenstein lacks considerable brio for a film about one of cinema s directorial giants .
>2
taken as a whole , the tuxedo does nt add up to a whole lot .
>2
this is no  waterboy ! 
>2
something has been lost in the translation ... another routine hollywood frightfest in which the slack execution italicizes the absurdity of the premise .
>2
the result is an  action film  mired in stasis .
>2
... a movie that , quite simply , should nt have been made .
>1
by turns pretentious , fascinating , ludicrous , provocative and vainglorious .
>2
i ca nt recommend it .
>1
but it s surprisingly harmless .
>1
what s next ?
>2
the script is a dimwitted pairing of teenspeak and animal gibberish .
>2
absolutely not .
>2
it sucked .
>2
a prison comedy that never really busts out of its comfy little cell .
>2
this is nt a movie  it s a symptom .
>2
what we have is a character faced with the possibility that her life is meaningless , vapid and devoid of substance , in a movie that is definitely meaningless , vapid and devoid of substance .

>2
does nt add up to much .
>2
one of the worst movies of the year .
>2
a complete waste of time .
>2
long before it s over , you ll be thinking of 51 ways to leave this loser .
>2
one of the worst movies of the year .
>2
