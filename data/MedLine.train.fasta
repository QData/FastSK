DRUG1 showed the most potent inhibition (66% inhibition at 10 microM), which was far more potent than that of crude DRUG2.

AIM AND BACKGROUND: The pharmacokinetic interaction between DRUG1, a DRUG2 metabolized by CYP3A4, and the GE GE was studied in 18 healthy subjects.

METHODS: Healthy subjects who were 20 to 43 years old participated in an open, three-period, randomized, crossover study of the pharmacokinetics of a single 10-mg oral dose of DRUG1, a single oral 120-mg dose of DRUG2, and the two drugs given together.

RESULTS: The geometric mean (90% confidence interval) whole blood DRUG1 area under the plasma concentration time-curve increased 60% (35%-90%), from 736 to 1178 ng x h/mL, and maximum concentration increased 43% (14%-81%), from 67 to 96 ng/mL, with GE coadministration, whereas the mean elimination half-life of DRUG2 decreased slightly, from 79 to 67 hours.

LABEL>0
The plasma maximum concentration and area under the plasma concentration-time curve of DRUG1, DRUG2, and GE were unchanged after coadministration of GE, and no potentiation of the effects of GE on diastolic or systolic blood pressure or on the electrocardiographic parameters was seen.
