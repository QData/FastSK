the actors do nt inhabit their roles  they re trapped by them , forced to change behavior in bizarre unjustified fashion and spout dialog that consists mostly of platitudes .
>2
an oftendeadly boring , strange reading of a classic whose witty dialogue is treated with a baffling casual approach
>2
this film was made to get laughs from the slowest person in the audience  just pure slapstick with lots of inane , inoffensive screaming and exaggerated facial expressions .
>2
consists of a plot and jokes done too often by people far more talented than ali g
>2
moderately involving despite bargainbasement photography and hackneyed romance .
>2
the editing is chaotic , the photography grainy and badly focused , the writing unintentionally hilarious , the direction unfocused , the performances as wooden .
>2
i doubt anyone will remember the picture by the time christmas really rolls around , but maybe it ll be on video by then .
>2
uncertain in tone ... a garbled exercise in sexual politics , a junior varsity short cuts by way of very bad things .
>2
the only thing worse than your substandard , runofthemill hollywood picture is an angstridden attempt to be profound .
>2
if you think that jennifer lopez has shown poor judgment in planning to marry ben affleck , wait till you see maid in manhattan .
>2
stars matthew perry and elizabeth hurley illicit more than a chuckle , and more jokes land than crash , but ultimately serving sara does nt distinguish itself from the herd .
>2
it s best to avoid imprisonment with the dull , nerdy folks that inhabit cherish .
>2
culkin exudes none of the charm or charisma that might keep a more general audience even vaguely interested in his bratty character .
>2
a movie that , rather than skip along the seine , more or less slogs its way through soggy paris , tongue uncomfortably in cheek .
>2
shot perhaps  artistically  with handheld cameras and apparently no movie lights by joaquin bacaasay , the lowbudget production swings annoyingly between vertigo and opacity .
>2
imagine a really bad community theater production of west side story without the songs .
>2
soul is what s lacking in every character in this movie and , subsequently , the movie itself .
>2
a onetrick pony whose few ta bits still ca nt save itself from being unoriginal , unfunny and unrecommendable .
>1
the production values are up there .
>1
the use of cgi and digital inkandpaint make the thing look really slick .
>1
the voices are fine as well .
>2
the problem , it is with most of these things , is the script .
>2
proves that a movie about goodness is not the same thing as a good movie .
>2
well , it does go on forever .
>2
this overproduced and generally disappointing effort is nt likely to rouse the rush hour crowd .
>2
topkapi this is not .
>2
if shayamalan wanted to tell a story about a man who loses his faith , why did nt he just do it , instead of using bad scifi as window dressing ?
>2
ethan hawke has always fancied himself the bastard child of the beatnik generation and it s all over his chelsea walls .
>2
i m not suggesting that you actually see it , unless you re the kind of person who has seen every wim wenders film of the 70s .
>2
while the film misfires at every level , the biggest downside is the paucity of laughter in what s supposed to be a comedy .
>1
if you liked the 1982 film then , you ll still like it now .
>2
a 93minute condensation of a 26episode tv series , with all of the pitfalls of such you d expect .
>2
guillen rarely gets beneath the surface of things .
>2
she lists ingredients , but never mixes and stirs .
>2
audiences can be expected to suspend their disbelief only so far  and that does not include the 5 oclock shadow on the tall wooden kid as he skips off to school .
>2
to imagine the life of harry potter as a martial arts adventure told by a lobotomized woody allen is to have some idea of the fate that lies in store for moviegoers lured to the mediocrity that is kung pow  enter the fist .
>2
it delivers some chills and sustained unease , but flounders in its quest for deeper meaning .
>2
credibility levels are low and character development a nonstarter .
>2
i would have preferred a transfer down the hall to mr. holland s class for the music , or to robin williams s lecture so i could listen to a teacher with humor , passion , and verve .
>2
but an unwillingness to explore beyond the surfaces of her characters prevents nettelbeck s film from coming together .
>1
an earnest , heartrending look at the divide between religious fundamentalists and their gay relatives .
>2
it s also heavyhanded and devotes too much time to bigoted views .
>2
a mawkish , implausible platonic romance that makes chaplin s city lights seem dispassionate by comparison .
>2
it s a film that hinges on its casting , and glover really does nt fit the part .
>2
this is a throwaway , junkfood movie whose rap soundtrack was better tended to than the film itself .
>2
... with the candylike taste of it fading faster than 25cent bubble gum , i realized this is a throwaway movie that wo nt stand the test of time .
>2
arguably the year s silliest and most incoherent movie .
>2
after that , it just gets stupid and maudlin .
>1
too bad , but thanks to some lovely comedic moments and several fine performances , it s not a total loss .
>2
he has not learnt that storytelling is what the movies are about .
>2
a mixed bag of a comedy that ca nt really be described as out of this world .
>2
the film is a travesty of the genre and even as spoof takes itself too seriously .
>2
marries the amateurishness of the blair witch project with the illogic of series 7  the contenders to create a completely crass and forgettable movie .
>2
the piano teacher is the sort of movie that discourages american audiences from ever wanting to see another foreign film .
>2
so what is the point ?
>1
lovingly choreographed bloodshed taking place in a pristine movie neverland , basically .
>2
this is junk food cinema at its greasiest .
>1
when it s all wet , blue crush is highly enjoyable .
>2
when it s on dry land , though , this surfergirl melodrama starts gasping like a beached grouper .
>1
most new movies have a bright sheen .
>2
some , like ballistic , arrive stillborn ... looking like the beaten , wellworn video box cover of seven years into the future .
>2
the story is naturally poignant , but firsttime screenwriter paul pender overloads it with sugary bits of business .
>2
a sermonizing and lifeless paean to teenage dullards .
>2
before long , the film starts playing like general hospital crossed with a saturday night live spoof of dog day afternoon .
>2
the charms of willful eccentricity , at least as evidenced by this latest cinematic essay , are beginning to wear a bit thin .
>2
instead of accurately accounting a terrible true story , the film s more determined to become the next texas chainsaw massacre .
>2
a silly , selfindulgent film about a silly , selfindulgent filmmaker .
>2
scarlet diva has a voyeuristic tug , but all in all it s a lot less sensational than it wants to be .
>2
the character is too forced and overwritten to be funny or believable much of the time , and clayburgh does nt always improve the overthetop mix .
>2
flashy , pretentious and as impenetrable as morvern s thick , workingclass scottish accent .
>2
lame , haphazard teen comedy .
>2
this miserable excuse of a movie runs on empty , believing flatbush machismo will get it through .
>2
expect to be reminded of other , better films , especially seven , which director william malone slavishly copies .
>2
nair stuffs the film with dancing , henna , ornamentation , and group song , but her narrative clichs and telegraphed episodes smell of old soap opera .
>2
it s getting harder and harder to ignore the fact that hollywood is nt laughing with us , folks .
>2
it s laughing at us .
>2
might have been better off as a documentary , with less of mr. eyre s uninspired dramatics and more of his sense of observation and outrage .
>1
for benigni it was nt shakespeare whom he wanted to define his career with but pinocchio .
>2
it might as well have been problem child iv .
>2
arnold s jump from little screen to big will leave frowns on more than a few faces .
>2
the lack of opposing viewpoints soon grows tiresome  the film feels more like a series of toasts at a testimonial dinner than a documentary .
>2
nothing plotwise is worth emailing home about .
>2
we are left with a superficial snapshot that , however engaging , is insufficiently enlightening and inviting .
>2
helmer devito ... attempts to do too many things in this story about ethics , payola , vice , murder , kids  tv and revenge .
>2
it would nt be my preferred way of spending 100 minutes or  7.00 .
>2
i hated every minute of it .
>2
obvious politics and rudimentary animation reduce the chances that the appeal of hey arnold !
>1
the movie will reach far beyond its core demographic .
>2
a simple , sometimes maddeningly slow film that has just enough charm and good acting to make it interesting , but is ultimately pulled under by the pacing and lack of creativity within .
>1
roger michell , who did an appealing job directing persuasion and notting hill in england , gets too artsy in his american debut .
>2
ostensibly celebrates middleaged girl power , even as it presents friendship between women as pathetic , dysfunctional and destructive .
>2
if this is an example of the type of project that robert redford s lab is willing to lend its imprimatur to , then perhaps it s time to rethink independent films .
>2
pumpkin sits in a patch somewhere between mirthless todd solondzian satire and callow student film .
>2
not so much funny as aggressively sitcomcute , it s full of throwaway oneliners , notquite jokes , and a determined tv amiability that allen personifies .
>2
it s just incredibly dull .
>2
the sad thing about knockaround guys is its lame aspiration for grasping the coolness vibes when in fact the film is nt as flippant or slick as it thinks it is .
>2
a cumbersome and clicheridden movie greased with every emotional device known to man .
>1
director ferzan ozpetek creates an interesting dynamic with the members of this group , who live in the same apartment building .
>2
but he loses his focus when he concentrates on any single person .
>2
egoyan s movie is too complicated to sustain involvement , and , if you ll excuse a little critical heresy , too intellectually ambitious .
>2
shadyac shoots his film like an m. night shyamalan movie , and he frequently maintains the same snail s pace  he just forgot to add any genuine tension .
>2
plays less like a comingofage romance than an infomercial .
>2
there are a few laughs and clever sight gags scattered about , but not enough to make this anything more than another bigbudget bust .
>2
the story s so preposterous that i did nt believe it for a second , despite the best efforts of everyone involved .
>2
they felt like the same movie to me .
>2
despite her relentless vim and winsome facial symmetry , witherspoon is just too dialedup to be america s sweetheart .
>2
an ultralowbudget indie debut that smacks more of good intentions than talent .
>2
birot is a competent enough filmmaker , but her story has nothing fresh or very exciting about it .
>1
de niro and mcdormand give solid performances , but their screen time is sabotaged by the story s inability to create interest .
>2
even those of a single digit age will be able to recognize that this story is too goofy ... even for disney .
>2
a compendium of solondz s own worst instincts in under 90 minutes .
>2
the story is familiar from its many predecessors  like them , it eventually culminates in the notexactly  stunning insight that crime does nt pay .
>2
you ll have more fun setting fire to yourself in the parking lot .
>2
you ll be more entertained getting hit by a bus .
>2
ritchie s treatment of the class reversal is majorly hamfisted , from the repetitive manifestos that keep getting thrown in people s faces to the fact amber is such a joke .
>2
flat , but with a revelatory performance by michelle williams .
>2
little more than a frothy vanity project .
>2
verbinski substitutes atmosphere for action , tedium for thrills .
>2
for all its surface frenzy , high crimes should be charged with loitering  so much on view , so little to offer .
>2
the sum of all fears is almost impossible to follow  and there s something cringeinducing about seeing an american football stadium nuked as pop entertainment .
>2
the title trapped turns out to be a pretty fair description of how you feel while you re watching this ultramanipulative thriller .
>2
ihops do nt pile on this much syrup .
>1
for the most part , i spy was an amusing lark that will probably rank as one of murphy s better performances in one of his lesserpraised movies .
>2
focuses on joan s raging hormones and sledgehammers the audience with spanish inquisitions about her  madness  so much that i became mad that i wasted 123 minutes and  9.50 on this 21st century torture device .
>2
this series should have died long ago , but they keep bringing it back another day as punishment for paying money to see the last james bond movie .
>2
a bit of an unwieldy mess .
>2
with a story as bizarre and mysterious as this , you do nt want to be worrying about whether the ineffectual broomfield is going to have the courage to knock on that door .
>2
the filmmakers juggle and juxtapose three story lines but fail to come up with one cogent point , unless it s that life stinks , especially for sensitive married women who really love other women .
>2
the movie feels like it s going to be great , and it carries on feeling that way for a long time , but takeoff just never happens .
>2
a gimmick in search of a movie  how to get carvey into as many silly costumes and deliver as many silly voices as possible , plot mechanics be damned .
>2
... the last time i saw a theater full of people constantly checking their watches was during my sats .
>2
... fifty minutes of tedious adolescent melodramatics followed by thirtyfive minutes of inflated nonsense .
>2
it s often faintly amusing , but the problems of the characters never become important to us , and the story never takes hold .
>2
there s no denying the elaborateness of the artist s conceptions , nor his ability to depict them with outrageous elan , but really the whole series is so much pretentious nonsense , lavishly praised by those who equate obscurity with profundity .
>2
characters wander into predictably treacherous situations even though they should know better .
>2
there s plenty of style in guillermo del toro s sequel to the 1998 hit but why do we need 117 minutes to tell a tale that simply ca nt sustain more than 90 minutes .
>2
no reason for anyone to invest their hardearned bucks into a movie which obviously did nt invest much into itself either .
>2
a strong first quarter , slightly less so second quarter , and average second half .
>2
a boring , wincingly cute and nauseatingly politically correct cartoon guaranteed to drive anyone much over age 4 screaming from the theater .
>2
the vampire thriller blade ii starts off as a wild hoot and then sucks the blood out of its fun  toward the end , you can feel your veins cringing from the workout .
>2
an afterschool special without the courage of its convictions .
>2
the final result makes for adequate entertainment , i suppose , but anyone who has seen chicago on stage will leave the theater feeling they ve watched nothing but a pale imitation of the real deal .
>2
so few movies explore religion that it s disappointing to see one reduce it to an idea that fits in a sampler .
>2
watching it is rather like viewing a long soap opera in which only the first episode was any good .
>2
there are touching moments in etoiles , but for the most part this is a dull , dour documentary on what ought to be a joyful or at least fascinating subject .
>2
could the whole plan here have been to produce something that makes fatal attraction look like a classic by comparison ?
>2
i did nt laugh at the ongoing efforts of cube , and his skinny buddy mike epps , to make like laurel and hardy n the hood .
>2
the only way this supernatural snorefest could give anyone a case of the frights is if they were put to sleep by the movie and had a nightmare .
>2
the film would work much better as a video installation in a museum , where viewers would be free to leave .
>2
not even the hanson brothers can save it
>2
the thriller side of this movie is falling flat , as the stalker does nt do much stalking , and no cop or lawyer grasps the concept of actually investigating the case .
>2
a sour , nasty offering .
>2
feels like one of those contrived , onlyin  hollywood productions where name actors deliver big performances created for the sole purpose of generating oscar talk .
>2
obstacles are too easily overcome and there is nt much in the way of character development in the script .
>2
earnest falls short of its ideal predecessor largely due to parker s illadvised meddling with the timeless source material .
>2
the film might have been more satisfying if it had , in fact , been fleshed out a little more instead of going for easy smiles .
>2
pretentious editing ruins a potentially terrific flick .
>2
not every animated film from disney will become a classic , but forgive me if i ve come to expect more from this studio than some 79minute afterschool  cartoon  .
>2
do not , under any circumstances , consider taking a child younger than middle school age to this wallow in crude humor .
>2
nothing debases a concept comedy quite like the grinding of bad ideas , and showtime is crammed full of them .
>2
muchanticipated and ultimately lackluster movie .
>2
neither funny nor suspenseful nor particularly welldrawn .
>2
 collateral damage  goes by the numbers and reps decent action entertainment  until the silly showdown ending that forces the viewer to totally suspend disbelief
>2
 enigma  is a good name for a movie this delibrately obtuse and unapproachable .
>2
a waste of good performances .
>2
a dreary , incoherent , selfindulgent mess of a movie in which a bunch of pompous windbags drone on inanely for two hours ... a cacophony of pretentious , meaningless prattle .
>2
i kept thinking over and over again ,  i should be enjoying this . 
>2
but i was nt .
>2
as conceived by mr. schaeffer , christopher and grace are little more than collections of quirky traits lifted from a screenwriter s outline and thrown at actors charged with the impossible task of making them jell .
>2
like so many other allegedly scary movies , it gets so tangled up in the twist that it chokes the energy right out of the very audience it seeks to frighten .
>2
the essential problem in orange county is that , having created an unusually vivid set of characters worthy of its strong cast , the film flounders when it comes to giving them something to do .
>2
just like hearst s enormous yacht , it s slow and unwieldy and takes a long time to reach its destination .
>2
there is not a character in the movie with a shred of plausibility , not an event that is believable , not a confrontation that is not staged , not a moment that is not false .
>2
where last time jokes flowed out of cho s life story , which provided an engrossing dramatic through line , here the comedian hides behind obviously constructed routines .
>2
why come up with something even quasioriginal , when you can pillage from shirley jackson , richard matheson ... and puke up something like rose red ?
>1
a broadly played , lowbrow comedy in which the cast delivers mildly amusing performances and no farm animals were injured by any of the gags .
>2
... too gory to be a comedy and too silly to be an effective horror film .
>2
lacks heart , depth and , most of all , purpose .
>1
though a bit of a patchwork in script and production , a glossy , rich green , environment almost makes the picture work .
>2
the premise is in extremely bad taste , and the film s supposed insights are so poorly thoughtout and substancefree that even a high school senior taking his or her first psychology class could dismiss them .
>2
sets up a nice concept for its fiftysomething leading ladies , but fails loudly in execution .
>2
imagine the james woods character from videodrome making a home movie of audrey rose and showing it to the kid from the sixth sense and you ve imagined the ring .
>2
this time kaufman s imagination has failed him .
>2
an intermittently pleasing but mostly routine effort .
>2
it becomes gimmicky instead of compelling .
>2
frenetic but not really funny .
>2
taken individually or collectively , the stories never add up to as much as they promise .
>2
if you re not a prepubescent girl , you ll be laughing at britney spears  moviestarring debut whenever it does nt have you impatiently squinting at your watch .
>2
a didactic and dull documentary glorifying software anarchy .
>2
sluggishly directed by episodic tv veteran joe zwick , it s a sitcom without the snapcrackle .
>2
you could nap for an hour and not miss a thing .
>2
new best friend should nt have gone straight to video  it should have gone straight to a mystery science theater 3000 video .
>2
began life as a computer game , then morphed into a movie  a bad one , of course .
>2
godawful boring slug of a movie .
>2
dull , if not devoid of wit , this shaggy dog longs to frisk through the back alleys of history , but scarcely manages more than a modest , snoozy charm .
>2
scenebyscene , things happen , but you d be hardpressed to say what or why .
>2
... an unimaginative , nasty , glibly cynical piece of work .
>1
it is also , at times , curiously moving .
>2
the tugofwar at the core of beijing bicycle becomes weighed down with agonizing contrivances , overheated pathos and long , wistful gazes .
>2
vile and tacky are the two best adjectives to describe ghost ship .
>2
some decent actors inflict big damage upon their reputations .
>2
being author wells  greatgrandson , you d think filmmaker simon wells would have more reverence for the material .
>2
but this costly dud is a far cry from either the book or the beloved film .
>2
offensive in the way it exploits the hotbutton issue of domestic abuse for cheap thrills and disgusting in the manner it repeatedly puts a small child in jeopardy , treating her as little more than a prop to be cruelly tormented .
>2
mark me down as a nonbeliever in werewolf films that are not serious and rely on stupidity as a substitute for humor .
>2
aspires for the piquant but only really achieves a sort of ridiculous sourness .
>2
accuracy and realism are terrific , but if your film becomes boring , and your dialogue is nt smart , then you need to use more poetic license .
>2
for all its highfalutin title and corkscrew narrative , the movie turns out to be not much more than a shaggy human tale .
>2
a soggy , clichebound epichorror yarn that ends up being even dumber than its title .
>2
one groaninducing familiarity begets another .
>2
although based on a reallife person , john , in the movie , is a rather dull person to be stuck with for two hours .
>2
with spy kids 2  the island of lost dreams writerdirectorproducer robert rodriguez has cobbled together a film that feels like a sugar high gone awry .
>2
there is no entry portal in the rules of attraction , and i spent most of the movie feeling depressed by the shallow , selfish , greedy characters .
>2
it s hard to tell with all the crashing and banging where the salesmanship ends and the movie begins .
>2
a dreadful liveaction movie .
>2
divertingly ridiculous , headbangingly noisy .
>2
a hideous , confusing spectacle , one that may well put the nail in the coffin of any future rice adaptations .
>2
all i can say is fuhgeddaboutit .
>2
between bedroom scenes , viewers may find themselves wishing they could roll over and take a nap .
>2
if you collected all the moments of coherent dialogue , they still would nt add up to the time required to boil a four  minute egg .
>2
every bit as bogus as most disney live action family movies are  no real plot , no real conflict , no real point .
>1
a sensual performance from abbass buoys the flimsy story , but her inner journey is largely unexplored and we re left wondering about this exoticlooking woman whose emotional depths are only hinted at .
>2
never engaging , utterly predictable and completely void of anything remotely interesting or suspenseful .
>2
spousal abuse is a major problem in contemporary society , but the film reduces this domestic tragedy to florid melodrama .
>2
oedekerk wrote patch adams , for which he should not be forgiven .
>2
why he was given free reign over this project  he wrote , directed , starred and produced  is beyond me .
>2
the creaking , rusty ship makes a fine backdrop , but the ghosts  haunting is routine .
>1
whatever eyre s failings as a dramatist , he deserves credit for bringing audiences into this hard and bitter place .
>2
it tries too hard , and overreaches the logic of its own world .
>2
the whole damn thing is ripe for the jerry springer crowd .
>2
it s all pretty cynical and condescending , too .
>2
i cry for i spy  or i would if this latest and laziest imaginable of all vintagetv spinoffs were capable of engendering an emotional response of any kind .
>2
a boring , formulaic mix of serial killers and stalk n slash .
>1
what you would end up with if you took orwell , bradbury , kafka , george lucas and the wachowski brothers and threw them into a blender .
>2
but that s just the problem with it  the director has nt added enough of his own ingredients .
>2
flaunts its quirky excesses like a new year s eve drunk sporting a paper party hat .
>2
writhing under dialogue like  you re from two different worlds  and  tonight the maid is a lie and this , this is who you are ,  this schlockfilled fairy tale hits new depths of unoriginality and predictability .
>2
... too slow , too boring , and occasionally annoying .
>2
schmaltzy and unfunny , adam sandler s cartoon about hanukkah is numbingly bad , little nicky bad , 10 worst list bad .
>2
it s really yet another anemic and formulaic lethal weaponderived buddycop movie , trying to pass off its lack of imagination as hip knowingness .
>2
scotland , pa. is a strangely drab romp .
>2
some studio pizazz might have helped .
>2
there s more scatological action in 8 crazy nights than a proctologist is apt to encounter in an entire career .
>2
too loud , too long and too frantic by half , die another day suggests that the bond franchise has run into a creative wall that 007 can not fly over , tunnel under or barrel through .
>2
... the sum of the parts equals largely a confused mediocrity .
>2
the tone shifts abruptly from tense to celebratory to soppy .
>2
if we do nt demand a standard of quality for the art that we choose , we deserve the trash that we get .
>2
a modest and messy metaphysical thriller offering more questions than answers .
>2
julia is played with exasperating blandness by laura regan .
>2
there s suspension of disbelief and then there s bad screenwriting ... this film packs a wallop of the latter .
>2
mocking them now is an exercise in pointlessness .
>2
this is a particularly toxic little bonbon , palatable to only a chosen and very jaundiced few .
>2
this is nt just the cliffsnotes version of nicholas nickleby , it s the cliffsnotes with pages missing .
>2
considering the harsh locations and demanding stunts , this must have been a difficult shoot , but the movie proves rough going for the audience as well .
>2
better at putting you to sleep than a sound machine .
>2
so clichd that , at one point , they literally upset an apple cart .
>1
it s a decent glimpse into a time period , and an outcast , that is no longer accessible , but it does nt necessarily shed more light on its subject than the popular predecessor .
>2
when the plot kicks in , the film loses credibility .
>2
credibility sinks into a mire of sentiment .
>2
the movie takes itself too seriously and , as a result , it makes for only intermittent fun .
>2
does nt amount to much of anything .
>2
bullock s complete lack of focus and ability quickly derails the film
>2
so stupid , so illconceived , so badly drawn , it created whole new levels of ugly .
>2
the truth is that the truth about charlie gets increasingly tiresome .
>2
some of seagal s action pictures are guilty pleasures , but this one is so formulaic that it seems to be on autopilot .
>2
a longwinded and stagy session of romantic contrivances that never really gels like the shrewd feminist fairy tale it could have been .
>2
a little too pat for its own good .
>2
there are films that try the patience of even the most cinemabesotted critic  and this was one of them .
>2
watching trouble every day , at least if you do nt know what s coming , is like biting into what looks like a juicy , delicious plum on a hot summer day and coming away with your mouth full of rotten pulp and living worms .
>2
wellintentioned though it may be , its soapopera morality tales have the antiseptic , preprogrammed feel of an afterschool special .
>2
he d create a movie better than this .
>2
when a set of preshooting guidelines a director came up with for his actors turns out to be cleverer , better written and of considerable more interest than the finished film , that s a bad sign .
>2
a very bad sign .
>2
still , this thing feels flimsy and ephemeral .
>1
diane lane shines in unfaithful .
>2
almost everything else is wan .
>2
rather , you ll have to wrestle disbelief to the ground and then apply the chloroformsoaked handkerchief .
>2
god help the poor woman if attal is this insecure in real life  his fictional yvan s neuroses are aggravating enough to exhaust the patience of even the most understanding spouse .
>2
let s cut to the consumeradvice bottom line  stay home .
>2
undercover brother does nt go far enough .
>2
it s just a silly black genre spoof .
>2
rates an  e  for effort  and a  b  for boring .
>2
even the unwatchable soapdish is more original .
>2
the movie bounces all over the map .
>2
but buying into sham truths and routine  indie  filmmaking , freundlich has made just another safe movie .
>2
it s not horrible , just horribly mediocre .
>2
feel bad for king , who s honestly trying , and schwartzman , who s shot himself in the foot .
>2
tom green just gives them a bad odor .
>2
this selfinfatuated goofball is far from the only thing wrong with the clumsy comedy stealing harvard , but he s the most obvious one .
>2
the enormous comic potential of an oafish idiot impersonating an aristocrat remains sadly unrealized .
>2
begins as a promising meditation on one of america s most durable obsessions but winds up as a slender cinematic stunt .
>2
a monster combat thriller as impersonal in its relentlessness as the videogame series that inspired it .
>2
proof that a thriller can be sleekly shot , expertly cast , paced with crisp professionalism ... and still be a letdown if its twists and turns hold no more surprise than yesterday s weather report .
>2
the reason we keep seeing the same movie with roughly the same people every year is because so many of us keep going and then , out of embarrassment or stupidity , not warning anyone .
>2
in the second half of the film , frei s control loosens in direct proportion to the amount of screen time he gives nachtwey for selfanalysis .
>2
extremely dumb .
>2
extremely confusing .
>2
extremely boring .
>2
we never really feel involved with the story , as all of its ideas remain just that  abstract ideas .
>2
for a shoot  em  up , ballistic is oddly lifeless .
>2
one minute , you think you re watching a serious actioner  the next , it s as though clips from the pink panther strikes again andor sailor moon have been spliced in .
>2
what happened with pluto nash ?
>2
how did it ever get made ?
>2
opens as promising as any waradventure film you ll ever see and dissolves into a routine courtroom drama , better suited for a movie titled  glory  a soldier s story . 
>2
the result is solemn and horrifying , yet strangely detached .
>2
these spiders can outrun a motorcycle and wrap a person in a sticky cocoon in seconds , but they fall short of being interesting or entertaining .
>2
a long slog for anyone but the most committed pokemon fan .
>2
matthew mcconaughey tries , and fails , to control the screen with swaggering machismo and overthetop lunacy .
>2
how on earth , or anywhere else , did director ron underwood manage to blow  100 million on this ?
>2
everyone connected to this movie seems to be part of an insider clique , which tends to breed formulaic films rather than fresh ones .
>2
with a story inspired by the tumultuous surroundings of los angeles , where feelings of marginalization loom for every dreamer with a burst bubble , the dogwalker has a few characters and ideas , but it never manages to put them on the same path .
>2
its lack of quality earns it a place alongside those other two recent dumas botchjobs , the man in the iron mask and the musketeer .
>2
a benign but forgettable scifi diversion .
>2
the plot grinds on with yawnprovoking dullness .
>2
it s never a good sign when a film s star spends the entirety of the film in a coma .
>2
it does nt help that the director and cinematographer stephen kazmierski shoot on grungy video , giving the whole thing a dirty , tasteless feel .
>2
desperately unfunny when it tries to makes us laugh and desperately unsuspenseful when it tries to make us jump out of our seats .
>2
this film s relationship to actual tension is the same as what christmastree flocking in a spray can is to actual snow  a poor  if durable  imitation .
>2
john mctiernan s botched remake may be subtler than norman jewison s 1975 ultraviolent futuristic corporatesports saga .
>2
it s also stupider .
>2
director dirk shafer and cowriter greg hinton ride the dubious divide where gay porn reaches for serious drama .
>2
borrows from so many literary and cinematic sources that this future world feels absolutely deja vu .
>2
the acting by the over25s lacks spark , with csokas particularly unconnected .
>2
though howard demonstrates a great eye as a director , this southern gothic drama is sadly a tough sit , with an undeveloped narrative and enough flashbacks and heavyhanded metaphors to choke a horse  or at least slow him down to a canter .
>2
falters when it takes itself too seriously and when it depends too heavily on its otherwise talented cast to clown in situations that are nt funny .
>2
the fight scenes are fun , but it grows tedious .
>2
can see where this dumbeddown concoction is going .
>2
all this turns out to be neither funny nor provocative  only dull .
>2
demme s loose approach kills the suspense .
>2
this idea has lost its originality ... and neither star appears very excited at rehashing what was basically a onejoke picture .
>2
the film is itself a sort of cinematic high crime , one that brings military courtroom dramas down very , very low .
>2
nothing more than a mediocre trifle .
>2
a turgid little history lesson , humourless and dull .
>2
too silly to be frightening , too stolid to be funny , it projects the same lazy affability as its nominal star , david arquette .
>2
if kaufman kept cameron diaz a prisoner in a cage with her ape , in his latest , he d have them mate .
>2
trivial where it should be profound , and hypercliched where it should be sincere .
>2
it would be hard to think of a recent movie that has worked this hard to achieve this little fun .
>2
theology aside , why put someone who ultimately does nt learn at the center of a kids  story ?
>2
the illconceived modernday ending falls flat where it should deliver a moral punch .
>2
collateral damage is , despite its alleged provocation post9  11 , an antique , in the end .
>2
as are its star , its attitude and its obliviousness .
>2
dawdles and drags when it should pop  it does nt even have the virtue of enough mindless violence to break up the tedium of all its generational bonding .
>2
its savetheplanet message clashes with its crass marketing .
>2
a great idea becomes a notgreat movie .
>2
... watching this film nearly provoked me to take my own life .
>1
and if the hours wins  best picture  i just might .
>2
by the end , i was looking for something hard with which to bludgeon myself unconscious .
>2
not a movie but a liveaction agitprop cartoon so shameless and coarse , it s almost funny .
>2
feels like six different movies fighting each other for attention .
>2
life is a crock  or something like it .
>2
made by jackasses for jackasses .
>2
despite a powerful portrayal by binoche , it s a period romance that suffers from an overly deliberate pace and uneven narrative momentum .
>2
the picture is a primer on what happens when lack of knowhow mixes with lack of giveadamn .
>2
bartleby is a onejoke movie , and a bad joke at that .
>2
given that both movies expect us to root for convicted violent felons over those assigned to protect us from same , we need every bit of sympathy the cons can muster  this time , there is nt much .
>2
a bravura exercise in emptiness .
>2
philip k. dick must be turning in his grave , along with my stomach .
>2
despite the premise of a good story ... it wastes all its star power on cliched or meaningless roles .
>2
not only does the movie fail to make us part of its reality , it fails the most basic relevancy test as well .
>2
first good , then bothersome .
>1
excellent acting and direction .
>2
this goofy gangster yarn never really elevates itself from being yet another earnestly generic crimebusting comic vehicle  a wellintentioned remake that shows some spunk and promise but fails to register as anything distinctive or daring
>2
it s difficult to say whether the tuxedo is more boring or embarrassing  i m prepared to call it a draw .
>2
even as lame horror flicks go , this is lame .
>2
so routine , familiar and predictable , it raises the possibility that it wrote itself as a newly automated final draft computer program .
>2
sunshine state lacks the kind of dynamic that limbo offers , and in some ways is a rather indulgent piece .
>2
even legends like alfred hitchcock and john huston occasionally directed trifles ... so it s no surprise to see a worldclass filmmaker like zhang yimou behind the camera for a yarn that s ultimately rather inconsequential .
>2
a longwinded , predictable scenario .
>2
too close to phantom menace for comfort .
>2
although trying to balance selfreferential humor and a normal ol slasher plot seemed like a decent endeavor , the result does nt fully satisfy either the diehard jason fans or those who can take a good joke .
>2
too clunky and too busy ribbing itself to be truly entertaining .
>2
it smacks of purely commercial motivation , with no great love for the original .
>2
too bad the former murphy brown does nt pop reese back .
>2
at the bottom rung of the series  entries .
>2
a real clunker .
>2
a dreary ripoff of goodfellas that serves as a muddled and offensive cautionary tale for hispanic americans .
>2
the picture , scored by a perversely cheerful marcus miller accordionharmonicabanjo abomination , is a monument to bad in all its florid variety .
>2
good for a few unintentional laughs ,  extreme ops  was obviously made for the  xxx  crowd , people who enjoy mindless action without the benefit of decent acting , writing , and direction .
>2
... a big , baggy , sprawling carnival of a movie , stretching out before us with little rhyme or reason .
>2
a frustrating combination of strained humor and heavyhanded sentimentality .
>2
as written by michael berg and michael j. wilson from a story by wilson , this relentless , allwiseguysallthetime approach tries way too hard and gets tiring in no time at all .
>2
will probably stay in the shadow of its two older , more accessible qatsi siblings .
>2
just when the movie seems confident enough to handle subtlety , it dives into soapy bathos .
>2
choppy editing and too many repetitive scenes spoil what could have been an important documentary about standup comedy .
>2
... the film falls back on the same old formula of teen sex , outrageous pranks and scenes designed to push the envelope of bad taste for laughs .
>2
the only thing in pauline and paulette that you have nt seen before is a scene featuring a football fieldsized oriental rug crafted out of millions of vibrant flowers .
>2
if you re looking for comedy to be served up , better look elsewhere .
>2
it virtually defines a comedy that s strongly mediocre , with funny bits surfacing every once in a while .
>2
an instant candidate for worst movie of the year .
>2
like a tonedeaf singer at a benefit concert , john q. is a bad movie appearing on behalf of a good cause .
>2
adam sandler is to gary cooper what a gnat is to a racehorse .
>1
what kids will discover is a new collectible .
>2
what parents will suspect is that they re watching a 76minute commercial .
>2
without september 11 , collateral damage would have been just another bad movie .
>2
now it s a bad , embarrassing movie .
>2
drags along in a dazed and enervated , drenchedinthe  past numbness .
>2
unless you are in dire need of a diesel fix , there is no real reason to see it .
>2
wait for video  and then do nt rent it .
>2
there s something fundamental missing from this story  something or someone to care about .
>2
too much of this wellacted but dangerously slow thriller feels like a preamble to a bigger , more complicated story , one that never materializes .
>2
when a film is created solely because it s a marketable product , soulless and ugly movies like this are the result .
>2
let your silly childhood nostalgia slumber unmolested .
>2
unfortunately , heartbreak hospital wants to convey the same kind of haughtiness in its own sketchy material but this territory has already been explored previously with better aplomb and sardonic wit .
>2
the more kevin costner rests on his prettyboy laurels , the public is , regrettably , going to have tepid films like dragonfly tossed at them .
>1
the latest installment in the pokemon canon , pokemon 4ever is surprising less moldy and trite than the last two , likely because much of the japanese anime is set in a scenic forest where pokemon graze in peace .
>2
but as a movie , it s a humorless , disjointed mess .
>2
if myers decides to make another austin powers movie , maybe he should just stick with austin and dr evil .
>2
the backyard battles you staged with your green plastic army men were more exciting and almost certainly made more sense .
>2
too stupid to be satire , too obviously hateful to be classified otherwise , frank novak s irritating slice of lumpen life is as reliably soulkilling as its title is nearly meaningless .
>2
what is captured during the conceptual process does nt add up to a sufficient explanation of what the final dance work , the selection , became in its final form .
>2
if this is satire , it s the smug and selfcongratulatory kind that lets the audience completely off the hook .
>2
these people would nt know subtle characterization if it put on a giant furry monster costume and then gave them a lapdance .
>2
imagine if you will a tony hawk skating video interspliced with footage from behind enemy lines and set to jersey shore techno .
>2
any film featuring young children threatened by a terrorist bomb can no longer pass as mere entertainment .
>2
about as satisfying and predictable as the fare at your local drive through .
>2
apparently kissing leads to suicide attempts and tragic deaths .
>2
marisa tomei is good , but just a kiss is just a mess .
>2
opens at a funeral , ends on the protagonist s death bed and does nt get much livelier in the three hours in between .
>2
the noble tradition of men in drag hits an alltime low in sorority boys , whose makers apparently believe that women s clothing can cover up any deficiency in acting , writing or direction .
>2
flaccid drama and exasperatingly slow journey .
>2
a chaotic panorama that s too busy flying a lot of metaphoric flags .
>2
suffers from rambling , repetitive dialogue and the visual drabness endemic to digital video .
>2
the screenplay sabotages the movie s strengths at almost every juncture .
>2
all the characters are stereotypes , and their interaction is numbingly predictable .
>2
a trashy , exploitative , thoroughly unpleasant experience .
>2
the performances are so leaden , michael rymer s direction is so bloodless and the dialogue is so corny that the audience laughs out loud .
>2
reggio s trippy , ambitious downer can also sometimes come across like nothing more than a glorified nike ad .
>2
as tweedy talks about canning his stockbroker and repairing his pool , you yearn for a few airborne tv sets or nude groupies on the nod to liven things up .
>2
if somebody was bored and ... decided to make a dull , pretentious version of jesus  son , they d come up with something like bart freundlich s world traveler .
>2
the best you can say about it is it s so uninspired , it barely gives one pause when considering some of the other dreck out there right now .
>1
a tough go , but leigh s depth and rigor , and his skill at inspiring accomplished portrayals that are all the more impressive for their lack of showiness , offsets to a notable degree the film s oftenmined and despairing milieu .
>2
an overstuffed compendium of teencatholicmovie dogma .
>2
ridiculous .
>1
what s next ?
>2
the movie s biggest offense is its complete and utter lack of tension .
>2
these are names to remember , in order to avoid them in the future .
>2
if this is the resurrection of the halloween franchise , it would have been better off dead .
>2
this formulaic chiller will do little to boost stallone s career .
>2
i saw knockaround guys yesterday , and already the details have faded like photographs from the spanishamerican war ... it s so unmemorable that it turned my ballpoint notes to invisible ink .
>2
though avary has done his best to make something out of ellis  nothing novel , in the end , his rules is barely worth following .
>2
the plot is so predictable and sentimental that viewers are likely to lose interest before sandrine and her goats walk off into the sunset .
>2
at first , the sight of a blind man directing a film is hilarious , but as the film goes on , the joke wears thin .
>2
never again swings between false sentiment and unfunny madcap comedy and , along the way , expects the audience to invest in the central relationship as some kind of marriage of true minds .
>2
the story itself is uninteresting , and the songs are painfully undistinguished  they might be giants  so to be one of us may be the most tuneless tune ever composed .
>2
technically , the film is about as interesting as an insurance commercial .
>2
the title s lameness should clue you in on how bad the movie is .
>2
the humor is hinged on the belief that knees in the crotch , elbows in the face and spit in the eye are inherently funny .
>2
it s a movie forged in the fires of chick flick hell .
>2
its characters are thinner than cardboard  or even comicbook paper .
>2
any one episode of the sopranos would send this illconceived folly to sleep with the fishes .
>2
lanie s professional success means she must be a failure at life , because she s driven by ambition and does nt know how to have fun .
>1
credit must be given to harland williams , michael rosenbaum and barry watson , who inject far more goodnatured spirit and talent into this project than it deserves
>2
denzel washington s efforts are sunk by all the sanctimony .
>2
rambles on in a disjointed , substandard fashion from one poorly executed action sequence to the next .
>2
there s an audience for it , but it could have been funnier and more innocent .
>2
i can only imagine one thing worse than kevin spacey trying on an irish accent , and that s sultry linda fiorentino doing the same thing .
>2
an awkward and indigestible movie .
>2
the movie has very little to offer besides unintentional laughs .
>2
guided more by intellect than heart , his story flattens instead of sharpens .
>2
all the wellmeaningness in the world ca nt erase the fact that the believer feels like a 12step program for the jewish nazi .
>2
like most sequels , it takes what worked last time , repeats it and adds more characters , more stunts , more stuff in attempt to camouflage its sameness .
>1
message movie or an actionpacked submarine spectacular ?
>2
alas , it s neither .
>2
no movement , no yuks , not much of anything .
>2
 dragonfly  is a movie about a bus wreck that turns into a film wreck .
>2
thirty years ago , it would have been groundbreaking .
>2
now it s just tired .
>2
a thinly veiled excuse for wilson to play his selfdeprecating act against murphy s wellhoned prima donna shtick .
>2
a minor picture with a major identity crisis  it s sort of true and it s sort of bogus and it s hohum all the way through .
>2
the movie succumbs to being nothing more than a formulaic chase in the dark .
>2
plays as hollow catharsis , with lots of tears but very little in the way of insights .
>2
it will come as no surprise that the movie is nt scary .
>2
but here s the real damn  it is nt funny , either .
>2
quick  who wants to see a comedy about shoddy airport security ?
>2
what you get with empire is a movie you ve seen many times before , repackaged as new material because there is a latino in the lead .
>2
cho s fans are sure to be entertained  it s only fair in the interest of full disclosure to say that  on the basis of this film alone  i m not one of them .
>2
looks awfully like one long tourist spot for a mississippi that may never have existed outside of a scriptwriter s imagination .
>2
the period  swinging london in the time of the mods and the rockers  gets the onceover once again in gangster no. 1 , but falls apart long before the end .
>2
high crimes miscasts nearly every leading character .
>2
the overall feel of the film is pretty cheesy , but there s still a real sense that the star trek tradition has been honored as best it can , given the embarrassing script and weak direction .
>2
de niro looks bored , murphy recycles murphy , and you mentally add showtime to the pile of hollywood dreck that represents nothing more than the art of the deal .
>2
i did nt believe for a moment in these villains or their plot .
>2
another rent installment for the ian fleming estate .
>1
with danilo donati s witty designs and dante spinotti s luscious cinematography , this might have made a decent children s movie  if only benigni had nt insisted on casting himself in the title role .
>2
so lazy and slipshod it confuses the mere flashing of kinky softcore imagery with naughty fun .
>2
has little on its mind aside from scoring points with drag gags .
>2
wellshot but badly written tale set in a future ravaged by dragons .
>2
sadly , hewitt s forte is leaning forward while wearing lowcut gowns , not making snappy comebacks .
>2
if melville is creatively a great whale , this film is canned tuna .
>2
this film is so slick , superficial and trendhoppy , that it s easy to imagine that a new software program spit out the screenplay .
>2
just one more collection of penis , breast and flatulence gags in search of a story .
>2
or some damn thing .
>2
the acting is stiff , the story lacks all trace of wit , the sets look like they were borrowed from gilligan s island  and the cgi scooby might well be the worst specialeffects creation of the year .
>2
enough trivializes an important crisis , reduces it to an almost comic embarrassment .
>2
the makers have forsaken the entertaining elements of the original and , instead , rehash old jokes and leave any life at the doorstep .
>1
i like frank the pug , though .
>2
gee , a second assassin shot kennedy ?
>2
moot point .
>2
a hysterical yet humorless disquisition on the thin line between sucking face and literally sucking face .
>2
needless to say , the dramatics that follow are utter hooey .
>2
madonna still ca nt act a lick .
>2
even the imaginative gore ca nt hide the musty scent of todd farmer s screenplay , which is a simple retread of the 1979 alien , with a plucky heroine battling a monster loose in a spaceship .
>2
if you pitch your expectations at an all time low , you could do worse than this oddly cheerful  but not particularly funny  bodyswitching farce .
>1
the episodic film makes valid points about the depersonalization of modern life .
>2
but the characters tend to be cliches whose lives are never fully explored .
>1
serry does a fine job of capturing the climate of the times and , perhaps unwittingly , relating it to what is happening in america in 2002 .
>2
but hardtobelieve plot twists force the movie off track in its final half hour .
>2
do nt let your festive spirit go this far .
>2
though the book runs only about 300 pages , it is so densely packed ... that even an ambitious adaptation and elaborate production like mr. schepisi s seems skimpy and unclear .
>2
intended to be a comedy about relationships , this wretched work falls flat in just about every conceivable area .
>2
director brian levant , who never strays far from his sitcom roots , skates blithely from one implausible situation to another , pausing only to tie up loose ends with more bows than you ll find on a french poodle .
>2
... perhaps the heaviest , most joyless movie ever made about giant dragons taking over the world .
>2
suggests puns about ingredients and soup and somebody being off their noodle , but let s just say the ingredients do nt quite add up to a meal .
>2
i d give real money to see the perpetrators of chicago torn apart by dingoes .
>2
the timing in nearly every scene seems a half beat off .
>1
a fairly bythebooks blend of action and romance with sprinklings of intentional and unintentional comedy .
>2
flounders due to the general sense that no two people working on the production had exactly the same thing in mind .
>2
the story bogs down in a mess of purposeless violence .
>1
despite some gulps the film is a fuzzy huggy .
>2
mckay deflates his piece of puffery with a sour cliche and heavy doses of meanspiritedness
>2
a recipe for cinematic disaster ... part quentin tarantino , part guy ritchie , and part 1960s spy spoof , it s all bad .
>2
the cumulative effect of the relentless horror on parade numbs the movie s power as a work of drama .
>2
another big , dumb action movie in the vein of xxx , the transporter is riddled with plot holes big enough for its titular hero to drive his sleek black bmw through .
>2
when she speaks , her creepy egyptian demigod voice is as computer processed and overproduced as it was in her music .
>2
outrageousness is all plympton seemed to be going for this time .
>2
we miss the quirky amazement that used to come along for an integral part of the ride .
>2
home alone goes hollywood , a funny premise until the kids start pulling off stunts not even steven spielberg would know how to do .
>2
for me , this opera is nt a favorite , so it s a long time before the fat lady sings .
>2
looks like a high school film project completed the day before it was due .
>2
truth to tell , if you ve seen more than halfadozen horror films , there s nothing here you have nt seen before .
>2
abandons all pretense of creating historical context and waltzes off into a hectic soap about the ups and downs of the heavy breathing between the two artists .
>2
even diehard fans of japanese animation ... will find this one a challenge .
>2
filmmakers have to dig deep to sink this low .
>2
fortunately for all involved , this movie is likely to disappear as quickly as an ice cube thrown into a pot of boiling water .
>2
the movie gets muted and routine .
>2
the issue of faith is not explored very deeply
>2
the situations and jokes are as predictable and as lowbrow as the endless pratfalls the boys take in their high heels .
>2
it s frustrating to see these guys  who are obviously pretty clever  waste their talent on parodies of things they probably thought were funniest when they were high .
>2
i was perplexed to watch it unfold with an astonishing lack of passion or uniqueness .
>2
k19 may not hold a lot of water as a submarine epic , but it holds even less when it turns into an elegiacally soggy saving private ryanovich .
>2
a very stylish but ultimately extremely silly tale ... a slick piece of nonsense but nothing more .
>2
automatically pegs itself for the straighttovideo scifi rental shelf .
>2
the film is like a series of beginnings and middles that never take off .
>2
feels less like it s about teenagers , than it was written by teenagers .
>2
it s badly acted , blandly directed , and could have been scripted by someone who just graduated from elementary school .
>2
you ve seen them a million times .
>2
the angstridden , affluent slacker characters are more grating than engaging .
>2
a soggy , shapeless mess ... just a dumb excuse for a waterlogged equivalent of a hauntedhouse movie .
>2
men in black ii has sequelitis something fierce .
>2
an ungainly , comedydeficient , bmovie rush job ...
>2
an unsatisfying hybrid of blair witch and typical stalkandslash fare , where the most conservative protagonist is always the last one living .
>2
say this for the soundtrack , it drowns out the lousy dialogue .
>2
after seeing swept away , i feel sorry for madonna .
>2
instead of kicking off the intrigue and suspense and mystery of the whole thing , hart s war , like the st. louis rams in the super bowl , waits until after halftime to get started .
>2
a gob of drivel so sickly sweet , even the eager consumers of moore s pasteurized ditties will retch it up like rancid crme brle .
>2
maudlin and melodramatic we expected .
>2
boring we did nt .
>2
never quite transcends jokester status ... and the punchline does nt live up to barry s deadeyed , perfectly chilled delivery .
>1
it almost plays like solaris , but with guns and jokes .
>2
it wo nt be long before you ll spy i spy at a video store near you .
>2
this film looks like it was produced in 1954 , shelved for 48 years , and repackaged for a 2002 audience .
>2
propelled not by characters but by caricatures .
>2
there is not an ounce of honesty in the entire production .
>2
this extremely unfunny film clocks in at 80 minutes , but feels twice as long .
>2
earnest but earthbound ... a slow , soggy , soporific , visually dank crime melodramacharacter study that would be more at home on the small screen but for its stellar cast .
>2
the pivotal narrative point is so ripe the film ca nt help but go soft and stinky .
>2
for all its alleged youthful fire , xxx is no less subservient to bond s tired formula of guns , girls and gadgets while brandishing a new action hero .
>2
a predictable and stereotypical little bmovie .
>2
frustratingly , dridi tells us nothing about el gallo other than what emerges through his music .
>2
places a slightly believable love triangle in a difficulttoswallow setting , and then disappointingly moves the story into the realm of an improbable thriller .
>2
a very average science fiction film .
>2
undone by its overly complicated and derivative screenplay , the glacierpaced direction and the stereotypical characters .
>2
the sort of movie that gives tastelessness a bad rap .
>2
the cold and dreary weather is a perfect metaphor for the movie itself , which contains few laughs and not much drama .
>2
the plot is straight off the shelf , the performances are television  caliber and the message of providing solace through deception is a little creepy .
>2
ordinary melodrama that is heavy on religious symbols but waferthin on dramatic substance
>2
those who managed to avoid the deconstructionist theorizing of french philosopher jacques derrida in college can now take an 85minute brushup course with the documentary derrida .
>2
jolie s performance vanishes somewhere between her hair and her lips .
>2
as with too many studio pics , plot mechanics get in the way of what should be the lighterthanair adventure .
>2
static , repetitive , muddy and blurry , hey arnold !
>2
would seem to have a lock on the title of ugliest movie of the year .
>2
when it comes to entertainment , children deserve better than pokemon 4ever .
>2
preposterous and tedious , sonny is spiked with unintentional laughter that , unfortunately , occurs too infrequently to make the film even a guilty pleasure .
>2
calling this movie brainless would be paying it a compliment  it s more like entertainment for trolls .
>2
none of these characters resembles anyone you ve ever met in real life , unless you happen to know annoyingly selfinvolved people who speak in glib sentences that could have only come from the pen of a screenwriter .
>2
... just a big mess of a movie , full of images and events , but no tension or surprise .
>2
as elegantly crafted as it often is , anderson s movie is essentially a onetrick pony that , hampered by an undeveloped script , ultimately pulls up lame .
>2
splashes its drama all over the screen , subjecting its audience and characters to action that feels not only manufactured , but also so false you can see the filmmakers  puppet strings .
>2
... has virtually no script at all ...
>2
will only satisfy those who ca nt tell the difference between the good , the bad and the ugly .
>2
at times , however , dogtown and zboys lapses into an insider s lingo and mindset that the uninitiated may find hard to follow , or care about .
>2
screenwriters scott abbott and michael petroni have turned rice s complex akasha into a cartoon monster .
>2
bad beyond belief and ridiculous beyond description .
>2
most of the action setups are incoherent .
>2
liman , of swingers and go , makes his bigbudget action film debut something of a clunker as he delivers a long , lowheat chase , interrupted by a middling car chase .
>2
... surprisingly inert for a movie in which the main character travels back and forth between epochs .
>2
the problem is nt that the movie hits so close to home so much as that it hits close to home while engaging in such silliness as that snakedownthethroat business and the inevitable shot of schwarzenegger outrunning a fireball .
>2
dreary , highly annoying ...  some body  will appeal to no one .
>2
the problem with concept films is that if the concept is a poor one , there s no saving the movie .
>2
sorry , charlie
>2
a painfully leaden film destined for predawn cable television slots .
>2
blessed with immense physical prowess he may well be , but ahola is simply not an actor .
>2
and in truth , cruel as it may sound , he makes arnold schwarzenegger look like spencer tracy .
>2
the cartoon that is nt really good enough to be on afternoon tv is now a movie that is nt really good enough to be in theaters .
>2
shocking only in that it reveals the filmmaker s bottomless pit of selfabsorption .
>2
this peptalk for faith , hope and charity does little to offend , but if saccharine earnestness were a crime , the film s producers would be in the clink for life .
>2
all ends well , sort of , but the frenzied comic moments never click .
>2
if this is the danish idea of a good time , prospective tourists might want to consider a different destination  some jolly country embroiled in a bloody civil war , perhaps .
>2
formula 51 is so trite that even yu s highenergy action stylings ca nt break through the stupor .
>2
when the painted backdrops in a movie are more alive than its characters , you know you re in trouble .
>2
the film is really not so much bad as bland .
>2
the central story lacks punch .
>2
though ganesh is successful in a midlevel sort of way , there s nothing so striking or fascinating or metaphorically significant about his career as to rate two hours of our attention .
>2
this may be the dumbest , sketchiest movie on record about an aspiring writer s comingofage .
>2
succumbs to the same kind of maudlin , sentimental mysticism that mars the touched by an angel school of nongod spiritualuplift movies .
>1
a harmless and mildly amusing family comedy .
>2
what was subtle and mystifying in the novella is now broad and farcical .
>2
the kids often appear to be reading the lines and are incapable of conveying any emotion .
>1
 men in black ii ,  has all the earmarks of a sequel .
>2
sucking all the  classic  out of robert louis stevenson s treasure island and filling the void with scifi video game graphics and disneyfied adolescent angst ...
>2
while super troopers is above academy standards , its quintet of writers could still use some more schooling .
>2
a mix of velocity and idiocy , this ruinous remake lacks the brawn  and the brains  of the 1970s original .
>2
the lowbudget full frontal was one of the year s murkiest , intentionally obscure and selfindulgent pictures , and solaris is its bigbudget brother .
>2
the plot is very clever , but boyd weighs it down with too many characters and events , all intertwined and far too complicated to keep track of .
>2
a freeforall of halfbaked thoughts , clumsily used visual tricks and selfindulgent actor moments .
>2
apallingly absurd ... the chemistry or lack thereof between newton and wahlberg could turn an imax theater into a 9  black and white portable tv .
>2
a well acted and well intentioned snoozer .
>2
the smug , oily demeanor that donovan adopts throughout the stupidly named pipe dream is just repulsive .
>1
mustsee viewing for anyone involved in the hightech industry .
>2
others may find it migraineinducing , despite moore s attempts at whimsy and spoon feeding .
>2
it s hard not to feel you ve just watched a featurelength video game with some really heavy back story .
>2
i watched the brainless insanity of no such thing with mounting disbelief .
>2
this limp genderbenderballer from a firsttime director and rookie screenwriter steals wholesale from that 1982 s tootsie , forgetting only to retain a single laugh .
>2
kwan makes the mixand  match metaphors intriguing , while lulling us into torpor with his cultivated allergy to action .
>2
any movie this boring should be required to have ushers in the theater that hand you a cup of coffee every few minutes .
>2
like a marathon runner trying to finish a race , you need a constant influx of liquid just to get through it .
>1
i loved looking at this movie .
>2
i just did nt care as much for the story .
>2
it does nt do the original any particular dishonor , but neither does it exude any charm or personality .
>2
fear dot com is so rambling and disconnected it never builds any suspense .
>2
it feels like a community theater production of a great broadway play  even at its best , it will never hold a candle to the original .
>2
it s the kind of movie you ca nt quite recommend because it is all windup and not much of a pitch , yet you ca nt bring yourself to dislike it .
>2
maybe it s asking too much , but if a movie is truly going to inspire me , i want a little more than this .
>2
a graceless , witless attempt at mating some like it hot with the wwii espionage thriller .
>2
the story and characters are nowhere near gripping enough .
>2
based on a david leavitt story , the film shares that writer s usual blend of observant cleverness , toofacile coincidence and slightly noxious preciousness .
>2
national lampoon s van wilder could be the worst thing to come out of national lampoon since class reunion
>2
this is a great subject for a movie , but hollywood has squandered the opportunity , using it as a prop for warmedover melodrama and the kind of choreographed mayhem that director john woo has built his career on .
>2
ecks this one off your mustsee list .
>2
overall , the film misses the brilliance of jelinek s novel by some way .
>2
it settles for being merely grim .
>2
the irwins emerge unscathed , but the fictional footage is unconvincing and criminally badly acted .
>2
no , it s the repetition of said behavior , and so children of the century is more mindless love than mad , more grating and boring than anything else .
>2
just because it really happened to you , honey , does nt mean that it s interesting to anyone else .
>2
this is nt a  friday  worth waiting for .
>2
uneasy mishmash of styles and genres .
>2
herzog is obviously looking for a moral to his fable , but the notion that a strong , unified showing among germany and eastern european jews might have changed 20thcentury history is undermined by ahola s inadequate performance .
>2
all in all , there s only one thing to root for  expulsion for everyone .
>2
beyond a handful of mildly amusing lines ... there just is nt much to laugh at .
>2
the film s center will not hold .
>2
myers never knows when to let a gag die  thus , we re subjected to one mindnumbingly lengthy riff on poo and pee jokes after another .
>2
too lazy to take advantage of its semihumorous premise .
>2
a great ending does nt make up for a weak movie , and crazy as hell does nt even have a great ending .
>2
dialogueheavy and too cerebral for its own good  or , at any rate , too cerebral for its racy subject matter .
>2
its overreliance on genre conventions , character types and formulaic conflict resolutions crushes all the goodwill it otherwise develops .
>2
as an actor , the rock is aptly named .
>2
a mostly tired retread of several other mob tales .
>2
i wish i could say  thank god it s friday  , but the truth of the matter is i was glad when it was over .
>2
nothing about it fits .
>2
as it abruptly crosscuts among the five friends , it fails to lend the characters  individual stories enough dramatic resonance to make us care about them .
>2
somehow we re meant to buy that this doting mother would shun her kids , travel to one of the most dangerous parts of the world , don fatigues and become g.i. jane .
>2
the cast is so lowwattage that none of the characters comes off as big ... and the setting remains indistinct .
>2
consider the title s clunkonthehead that suggests the overtime someone put in to come up with an irritatingly unimaginative retread concept .
>2
the movie quickly drags on becoming boring and predictable .
>2
i tried to read the time on my watch .
>2
the film makes a tragic error by going on for too long , trying to mirror every subsequent event in chinese history  war , revolution , communism , etc. .
>2
ultimately the project comes across as clinical , detached , uninvolving , possibly prompting audience members to wonder ,  what s the point ? 
>2
the two leads are almost good enough to camouflage the dopey plot , but so much naturalistic small talk , delivered in almost muffled exchanges , eventually has a lulling effect .
>2
the film meant well in its horse tale about freedom , but was nt able to reach the heart because it was too overbearing .
>2
the movie is as far as you can get from racy , to the point where it almost stops the blood flow to your brain  it has a dull , costumey feel .
>2
once the audience figure out what s being said , the filmmaker s relative passivity will make it tough for them to really care .
>2
there s nothing provocative about this film save for the ways in which it studiously avoids provoking thought .
>2
the premise for this kegger comedy probably sounded brilliant four sixpacks and a pitcher of margaritas in , but the film must have been written ... in the thrall of a vicious hangover .
>2
even by dumb actionmovie standards , ballistic  ecks vs. sever is a dumb action movie .
>2
the film equivalent of a toy chest whose contents get scattered over the course of 80 minutes .
>2
just a bloody mess .
>2
creepy but ultimately unsatisfying thriller .
>2
you would be better off investing in the worthy emi recording that serves as the soundtrack , or the home video of the 1992 malfitanodomingo production .
>2
bears is bad .
>2
not  terrible filmmaking  bad , but more like ,  i once had a nightmare like this , and it s now coming true  bad .
>2
george , hire a real director and good writers for the next installment , please .
>2
for a film about two mismatched buddies , crystal and de niro share little screen time and even less chemistry .
>2
extreme oops  oops , ops , no matter how you spell it , it s still a mistake to go see it .
>2
what could and should have been biting and droll is instead a tepid waste of time and talent .
>2
what will , most likely , turn out to be the most repellent movie of 2002 .
>2
... too dull to enjoy .
>2
here s a selfcongratulatory 3d imax rahrah .
>1
eastwood is an icon of moviemaking , one of the best actors , directors and producers around , responsible for some excellent work .
>2
but even a hero can stumble sometimes .
>2
a sophomoric exploration of  life problems  most people solved long ago  or at least got tired of hearing people kvetch about .
>1
it s all very cute , though not terribly funny if you re more than six years old .
>2
the impact of the armenian genocide is diluted by too much stage business in the modern day .
>2
lacking gravitas , macdowell is a placeholder for grief , and ergo this sloppy drama is an empty vessel .
>2
leave these flowers unpicked  they re dead on the vine .
>2
for caine lovers only .
>2
a shambles of a movie  visually unattractive , unbearably loud and utterly silly ... its hilarity is completely unintentional .
>2
de niro may enjoy the same free ride from critics afforded to clint eastwood in the lazy bloodwork .
>2
but like bruce springsteen s gonetopot asbury park , new jersey , this sadsack waste of a movie is a city of ruins .
>2
no , it s not nearly as good as any of its influences .
>2
human nature talks the talk , but it fails to walk the silly walk that distinguishes the merely quirky from the surreal .
>1
city by the sea is the cinematic equivalent of defensive driving  it s careful , conscientious and makes no major mistakes .
>2
but what saves lives on the freeway does not necessarily make for persuasive viewing .
>2
the marquis de sade could nt have been as dull a person as this film makes him out to be .
>2
what could have been a neat little story about believing in yourself is swamped by heavyhanded melodrama .
>2
the whole thing plays out with the drowsy heaviness of synchronized swimmer wearing a wool wetsuit .
>2
fairly successful at faking some pretty cool stunts but a complete failure at trying to create some pretty cool characters .
>2
and forget about any attempt at a plot !
>2
it s so full of wrong choices that all you can do is shake your head in disbelief  and worry about what classic oliver parker intends to mangle next time .
>2
showtime is closer to slowtime .
>2
it may be an easy swipe to take , but this barbershop just does nt make the cut .
>2
the weight of water uses water as a metaphor for subconscious desire , but this leaky script barely stays afloat .
>2
despite a bluechip cast and a provocative title , writerdirector peter mattei s first feature microwaves dull leftover romantic motifs basted in fauxcontemporary gravy .
>2
the only element of suspense is whether the movie will change titles or distributors again before the closing credits roll .
>2
barely goes beyond comic book status .
>2
it s disappointing when filmmakers throw a few bigname actors and cameos at a hokey script .
>2
i spy is an embarrassment , a monotonous , disjointed jumble of borrowed plot points and situations .
>2
it s as flat as an open can of pop left sitting in the sun .
>1
an eccentric little comicthriller deeply in love with its own quirky personality .
>2
afraid to pitch into farce , yet only halfhearted in its spy mechanics , all the queen s men is finally just one long drag .
>2
maybe it s the star power of the cast or the redundant messages , but something aboul  full frontal  seems , well , contrived .
>2
safe conduct , however ambitious and wellintentioned , fails to hit the entertainment bull s  eye .
>2
my response to the film is best described as lukewarm .
>2
maybe i found the proceedings a little bit too conventional .
>2
too timid to bring a sense of closure to an ugly chapter of the twentieth century .
>2
it s pushthelimits teen comedy , the type written by people who ca nt come up with legitimate funny , and it s used so extensively that good bits are hopelessly overshadowed .
>2
a movie that tries to fuse the two  woods  but winds up a bollyholly masala mess .
>1
mr. wedge and mr. saldanha handle the mix of verbal jokes and slapstick well .
>2
their film falters , however , in its adherence to the disney philosophy of required poignancy , a salute that i d hoped the movie would avoid .
>2
leaves you with a knot in your stomach , its power is undercut by its own headbanging obviousness .
>2
watching it is rather like an overlong visit from a large group of your relatives .
>2
as your relatives swap one mundane story after another , you begin to wonder if they are ever going to depart .
>2
unfortunately , as a writer , mr. montias is nt nearly as good to his crew as he is as a director or actor .
>2
on the right track to something that s creepy and effective ... it s just going to take more than a man in a bullwinkle costume to get there .
>2
the only thing that could possibly make them less interesting than they already are is for them to get full montied into a scrappy , jovial team .
>2
one of those movies where you walk out of the theater not feeling cheated exactly , but feeling pandered to , which , in the end , might be all the more infuriating .
>2
... this movie has a glossy coat of action movie excess while remaining heartless at its core .
>2
murder by numbers is like a couple of mediocre tvmovie  oftheweek films clumsily stuck together .
>1
the film is surprisingly welldirected by brett ratner , who keeps things moving well  at least until the problematic third act .
>2
warmedover tarantino by way of wannabe elmore leonard .
>2
showtime is one of the hapless victims of the arrogant  if we put together a wry white man and a chatty black man and give them guns , the movie will be funny  syndrome .
>2
sushi for the connoisseurs of the macabre .
>2
do nt waste your money .
>2
there s not enough to sustain the comedy .
>2
like those to rome , all roads in the banger sisters inevitably lead to a joke about hawn s breasts , which constantly threaten to upstage the woman sporting them .
>2
you re better off staying home and watching the xfiles .
>2
chaotic , selfindulgent and remarkably ugly to look at , it s ... like a series of pretentiously awful student films strung together into one featurelength horror .
>2
this is the type of movie best enjoyed by frat boys and college kids while sucking on the bong and downing one alcoholic beverage after another .
>2
friday after next has the same problem that next friday did  it s called where s chris tucker when you need him ?
>2
but like most rabbits , it seems to lack substance .
>2
i weep for the future when a good portion of the respected critical community in this country consider blue crush to be an intelligent film about young women .
>2
i kept wishing i was watching a documentary about the wartime navajos and what they accomplished instead of all this specious hollywood hooha .
>2
no number of fantastic sets , extras , costumes and spectacular locales can disguise the emptiness at the center of the story .
>2
a movie far more cynical and lazy than anything a fictitious charlie kaufman might object to .
>2
could the country bears really be as bad as its trailers ?
>2
if high crimes were any more generic it would have a universal product code instead of a title .
>2
reggio falls victim to relying on the very digital technology that he fervently scorns , creating a meandering , inarticulate and ultimately disappointing film .
>2
the movie makes absolutely no sense .
>2
its underlying mythology is a hodgepodge of inconsistencies that pose the question  since when did dumb entertainment have to be this dumb ?
>2
the problem with this film is that it s forced to make its characters idiots in order to advance the plot .
>2
had anyone here done anything remotely intelligent , we all could have stopped watching long ago .
>2
despite the authenticity of the trappings , the film is overblown in its plotting , hackneyed in its dialogue and anachronistic in its style .
>2
murder and mayhem of this sort quickly becomes monotonous .
>1
that zhang would make such a strainingly cute film  with a blind orphan at its center , no less  indicates where his ambitions have wandered .
>2
the streets , shot by cinematographer michael ballhaus , may be as authentic as they are mean , but it is nearly impossible to care about what happens on them .
>2
flotsam in the sea of moviemaking , not big enough for us to worry about it causing significant harm and not smelly enough to bother despising .
>2
a tv episode inflated past its natural length .
>2
involving at times , but lapses quite casually into the absurd .
>2
all these developments and challenges facing santa weigh down the plot so heavily that they drain all the film of its energy and needlessly strain credibility .
>2
there are weird resonances between actor and role here , and they re not exactly flattering .
>2
the unceasing sadism is so graphically excessive , the director just ends up exposing his own obsession .
>2
the story ... is moldy and obvious .
>2
it s drained of life in an attempt to be sober and educational , and yet it s so devoid of realism that its lack of whistles and bells just makes it obnoxious and stiff .
>2
suffocated at conception by its munchausenbyproxy mum .
>2
punish the vehicle to adore the star .
>2
even if britney spears is really cute , her movie is really bad .
>2
big fat liar is just futile silliness looking to tap into the kiddie sensibilities .
>2
usually when i get this much syrup , i like pancakes to go with it .
>2
all the necessary exposition prevents the picture from rising above your generic sand n sandal adventure .
>2
glib , satirical documentary that fudges facts , makes facile points and engages in the cinematic equivalent of tabloid journalism .
>2
gangs of new york is an unapologetic mess , whose only saving grace is that it ends by blowing just about everything up .
>2
an overblown clunker full of bad jokes , howling cliches and bythenumbers action sequences .
>2
without a strong script and energetic acting , dogma films can produce the same sleepinducing effects as watching your neighbor s home videos .
>2
strong setup and ambitious goals fade as the film descends into unsophisticated scare tactics and bfilm thuggery .
>2
schindler s list it ai nt .
>2
it s an awfully derivative story .
>2
about as cuttingedge as pet rock  the movie .
>2
with generic sets and bgrade special effects , jason is about as convincing on the scifi front as tv s defunct cleopatra 2525 .
>2
not sweet enough to liven up its predictable story and will leave even fans of hiphop sorely disappointed .
>2
winds up feeling like lots of other quirky movies that try to score hipness points with young adults .
>2
oftdescribed as the antidote to american pietype sex comedies , it actually has a bundle in common with them , as the film diffuses every opportunity for a breakthrough
>2
the premise is overshadowed by the uberviolence of the clericks as this becomes just another kungfu scifi movie with silly action sequences .
>2
with its hints of a greater intelligence lurking somewhere , the ring makes its stupidity more than obvious .
>2
it s painful .
>2
an uneven film dealing with too many problems to be taken seriously .
>2
an atonal estrogen opera that demonizes feminism while gifting the most sympathetic male of the piece with a nice vomit bath at his wedding .
>2
half of it is composed of snappy patter and pseudosophisticated cultural observations , while the remainder ... would be more at home on a daytime television serial .
>2
writerdirector john mckay ignites some charming chemistry between kate and jed but , when he veers into sodden melodrama , punctuated by violins , it s disastrous and kate s jealous female friends become downright despicable .
>2
unfortunately , the picture failed to capture me .
>2
i found it slow , drab , and bordering on melodramatic .
>2
a lousy movie that s not merely unwatchable , but also unlistenable .
>2
the best way to hope for any chance of enjoying this film is by lowering your expectations .
>2
then lower them a bit more .
>2
cliches are as thick as the cigarette smoke .
>2
a woozy , roisterous , exhausting mess , and the offbeat casting of its two leads turns out to be as illstarred as you might expect .
>2
 abandon all hope , ye who enter here  ... you should definitely let dante s gloomy words be your guide .
>2
a grim , flat and boring werewolf movie that refuses to develop an energy level .
>2
watching the film is like reading a times portrait of grief that keeps shifting focus to the journalist who wrote it .
>2
enough similarities to gymkata and howie long s firestorm that my fingernails instinctively crawled towards my longsuffering eyeballs .
>1
succeeds in providing a disquiet world the longdreaded completion of the police academy series .
>1
christians sensitive to a reductionist view of their lord as a luvspreading dr. feelgood or omnipotent slacker will feel vastly more affronted than secularists , who might even praise god for delivering such an instant camp classic .
>2
if this dud had been made in the 70s , it would have been called the hills have antlers and played for about three weeks in driveins .
>2
a frantic search for laughs , with a hittomiss ratio that does nt exactly favour the audience .
>2
 an entire film about researchers quietly reading dusty old letters . 
>2
pryor lite , with half the demons , half the daring , much less talent , many fewer laughs .
>2
what s at stake in this film is nothing more than an obsolete , if irritating , notion of class .
>2
the stories here suffer from the chosen format .
>2
while the mystery surrounding the nature of the boat s malediction remains intriguing enough to sustain mild interest , the picture refuses to offer much accompanying sustenance in the way of characterization , humor or plain old popcorn fun .
>2
i regret to report that these ops are just not extreme enough .
>2
the actors are forced to grapple with hazy motivations that never come into focus .
>2
john leguizamo may be a dramatic actor  just not in this movie .
>2
the sequel has turned completely and irrevocably bizarre to the point of utter nonsense .
>2
rainy days and movies about the disintegration of families always get me down .
>2
the master of disaster  it s a piece of dreck disguised as comedy .
>2
the stupidest , most insulting movie of 2002 s first quarter .
>2
it s so underwritten that you ca nt figure out just where the other characters , including ana s father and grandfather , come down on the issue of ana s future .
>2
a film so tedious that it is impossible to care whether that boast is true or not .
>2
none of this violates the letter of behan s book , but missing is its spirit , its ribald , fullthroated humor .
>2
bad company leaves a bad taste , not only because of its badluck timing , but also the staleness of its script .
>2
fails to bring as much to the table .
>2
a film made with as little wit , interest , and professionalism as artistically possible for a slummy hollywood caper flick .
>2
disturbingly superficial in its approach to the material .
>2
if you re not the target demographic ... this movie is one long chickflick slog .
>2
i hate this movie
>1
an imaginative comedythriller .
>1
lrb a rrb rare , beautiful film .
