FastSK Basic Functions 
===========================

Welcome to the documentation for FastSK!

What is FastSK?
----------------------
`FastSK <https://github.com/QData/FastSK>`__ is a Python library for fast algorithmic implementation of gkm-svm string kernel for SVM based string classification and regression. 


Where should I start?
----------------------

This is a great question, and one we get a lot. First of all, almost everything in FastSK can be done in two ways: via the command-line or via the Python API. If you're looking to integrate FastSK into an existing project, the Python API is likely for you. If you'd prefer to use built-in functionality end-to-end, then you can just use the python library API.


For future developers, visit the :ref:`Installation <installation>` page for more details about installing FastSK onto your own computer. To start making contributions, read the detailed instructions `here <https://FastSK.readthedocs.io/en/latest/1start/support.html>`__.

FastSK has some other features that make it a pleasure to use:

- :ref:`baseline ` for running baselines 
- :ref:`data `, a utility class for tools preprocessing strings fasta format
