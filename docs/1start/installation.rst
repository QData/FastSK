Installation
==============

To use FastSK, you must be running Python 3.6+. Tensorflow needs to be installed for users, and Java needs to be installed for developers. A CUDA-compatible GPU is optional but will greatly improve speed. To install, simply run::

    pip install fastsk 

You're now all set to use FastSK!
